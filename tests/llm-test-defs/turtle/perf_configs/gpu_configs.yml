# Default clock settings on GPU cards. These values are Default Applications Clocks
# which are queried from "nvidia-smi -q -d CLOCK" or "nvmlDeviceGetDefaultApplicationsClock()".
# We observe these clocks are unlike to trigger power-throttle, and that's why we think these
# values are good for testing performance regressions.
