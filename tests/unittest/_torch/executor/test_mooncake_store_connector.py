"""Unit tests for the Mooncake store KV cache connector.

Covers the three places a defect is a wrong answer rather than a slow one: the
arithmetic that maps a store key onto KV cache memory, the host staging that
has to leave a staged transfer byte-identical to a zero-copy one, and the
scheduler state that decides which pages are published under which key.

Runs without a Mooncake installation and without a GPU: the store handle is
replaced by an in-process fake, and the KV cache layout is synthesized from
plain integers, which is all the addressing arithmetic needs.
