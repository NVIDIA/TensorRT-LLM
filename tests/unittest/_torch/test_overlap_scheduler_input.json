He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nA. Jean Jacques Rousseau\nB. Baron Montesquieu\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft\nD.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin....\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nYour response should end with \"The best answer is [the_answer_letter]\" where the [the_answer_letter] is one of A, B, C or D.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe best answer is A.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nGiven the following question and four candidate answers (A, B, C and D), choose the best answer.\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn order to make the title of this discourse generally intelligible, I have translated the term \"Protoplasm,\" which is the scientific name of the substance of which I am about to speak, by the words \"the physical basis of life.\" I suppose that, to many, the idea that there is such a thing as a physical basis, or matter, of life may be novel\u2014so widely spread is the conception of life as something which works through matter. \u2026 Thus the matter of life, so far as we know it (and we have no right to speculate on any other), breaks up, in consequence of that continual death which is the condition of its manifesting vitality, into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which certainly possess no properties but those of ordinary matter.\nThomas Henry Huxley, \"The Physical Basis of Life,\" 1868\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Huxley argued that \"life\" was\nA. a force that works through matter\nB. essentially a philosophical notion\nC. merely a property of a certain kind of matter\nD. a supernatural phenomenon\nYour response should end with \"The best answer is [the_answer_letter]\" where the [the_answer_letter] is one of A, B, C or D.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe best answer is"
