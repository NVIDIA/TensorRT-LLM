and gratuity.  **Provident Fund (PF)** - Both employer \\& employee stipulated funds A provident fund is a part of your salary that is deducted every month and deposited with the Employee Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) under your name. Normally 12% of your basic monthly salary is deposited in the EPFO while a matching percentage is contributed by ServiceNow. While your contribution is fully invested, the employer's contribution is partly invested along with your funds and partly utilized for providing other benefits like Pensions and Employee Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) premiums. When an employee leaves his/her job, a part of this amount can be withdrawn as per the governing withdrawal rules. If the employee attains retirement age, then the Provident Fund can be partly withdrawn and partly used for purchasing a life annuity plan that provides a monthly pension. **Policy Rules:** Please refer to Benefits Information in the [benefits portal.](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/servicenow.okta.com/home/thomsonsonlinebenefits/0oa1g1v3i17DiSuob0h8/38923?fromHome=true__;!!N4vogdjhuJM!Vyvf3ceOERltigdu08bwjhFaS6SzovSGcXfj6H7vRqzpUz_C1AJ5rSTXDQh037j1frPr9vC0bKY$) **Need to avail?** Please [raise a request](https://my.servicenow.com/esc?id=service_catalog&spa=1&sc_catalog=0c0369b4db555300b2e2d34b5e9619fe&sc_category=undefined&sc_cat_item=0284fe44130dd240796ad1e2e144b0f9) in the My ServiceNow Portal with Payroll. **New to ServiceNow?** Soon after joining ServiceNow, you will be automatically enrolled in PF, and you need to provide the required details to Payroll for processing. **Need Help?** Please [rai](https://my.servicenow.com/esc?id=service_catalog&spa=1&sc_catalog=0c0369b4db555300b2e2d34b5e9619fe&sc_category=undefined&sc_cat_item=0284fe44130dd240796ad1e2e144b0f9)[se a request](https://my.servicenow.com/esc?id=service_catalog&spa=1&sc_catalog=0c0369b4db555300b2e2d34b5e9619fe&sc_category=undefined&sc_cat_item=0284fe44130dd240796ad1e2e144b0f9)in the My ServiceNow Portal with Payroll. **Gratuity:** An employee completing almost 5 years or more of uninterrupted service can claim this benefit.

What are the benefits of a distributed, flexible work model?**\n\n**A.** We have adopted a distributed, flexible work model that is right for Our World of Work. We reshaped our connections with each other, adapted the intent and purpose of the workplace, and used the power of the Now Platform to do our best work together.  What about if I change my status to remote but still live in the same area?**\n\n**A**. Work personas by themselves do not affect compensation, but the market tier you work in will (only in the United States). If your work persona is flexible or required-in-office, your compensation is based on your office location. If you are remote, then your compensation is based on your remote work location. Refer to the [market tiers for the United States](https://my.servicenow.com/esc?id=surf_kb_article&number=KB0005540).\n\n[**Go to top**](#Top1 \"Go to top\")\n\n{#WPN3}\n\n**Q.** **Why have we clarified that our expectation for the flexible work persona is two or more days a week in the office?**\n\n**A.**By getting more specific on expectation of number of days spent in the office, we will bring more clarity for and ultimately drive consistency for employees in the flexible work persona across the company. We feel that two or more days a week will help facilitate the benefits and advantages of 'shoulder-to-shoulder' work. We know how valuable remote work is as well, and that's why we continue to lead Our World of Work with your flexibility and choice in mind.\n\n[**Go to top**](#Top1 \"Go to top\")\n\n{#WPN4}\n\n**Q. What happens if I don't come into the office two or more days a week?**\n\n**A.**Your manager may check in with you during regular discussions on whether you're adhering to the expectation of two or more days each week. If you're not regularly coming to the office, your manager may partner with you to create a plan that supports you meeting the expectation for being in the office. For now, there are no formal consequences for not meeting this expectation.\n\n[**Go to top**](#Top1 \"Go to top\")\n\n{#WPN5}\n\n**Q. What if I have a personal circumstance that may make it difficult for me to meet the two or more days a week in-office expectation?**\n\n**A.**Bill said it best: There's something incalculable in ServiceNow's culture about working \"shoulder-to-shoulder.\" We come together to do meaningful work while getting to know our colleagues. We believe that working with your team (and across teams) in person fosters even greater collaboration and innovation, builds social wellbeing via the relationships we develop, and actively cultivates ServiceNow's culture. Thus, we feel that those who live close to ServiceNow offices are a natural fit for the flexible persona. It is reasonable to ask you to be present in our offices without burdensome commutes that unduly impact your personal time.\n\nIf you have a personal circumstance that prevents you from meeting the expectations of the flexible work persona and you would like to request an accommodation, please use these resources:\n\n* Employees in the U.S. can reference [this workplace accommod...\"\n  }\n]\n\n\nCATALOG_ITEMS:\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"cat_1\",\n    \"title\": \"Benefits - General\",\n    \"description\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"cat_2\",\n    \"title\": \"Benefits Coverage\",\n    \"description\": \"For questions related to your benefits including your coverage, enrolling in or changing your benefits, portal login issues, business traveler benefits, or benefit changes related to leaves of absence (LOA) please use this request\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"cat_3\",\n    \"title\": \"Benefits - 401(k)\",\n    \"description\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"cat_4\",\n    \"title\": \"IN - Benefits & Insurance details\",\n    \"description\": \"**Please add your dependent details for medical insurance policy.**\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"cat_5\",\n    \"title\": \"Benefits - Leave / LOA\",\n    \"description\": \"\"\n  }\n]"
