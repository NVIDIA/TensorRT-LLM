    # Step 1: run a standard checkout action, provided by github
    - name: Checkout main

      with:
        ref: main
        submodules: 'recursive'     ### may be needed in your situation

    # Step 2: run this sync action - specify the upstream repo, upstream branch to sync with, and target sync branch
    - name: Pull (Fast-Forward) upstream changes
      id: sync

        git_pull_args: 'rebase'                   # optional arg use, defaults to simple 'pull'
        # github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}   # optional, for accessing repos that require authentication

    # Step 3: Display a message if 'sync' step had new commits (simple test)
