### kill

`kill  `

Kill all running builds associated with pull request.

### skip

`skip --comment COMMENT `

Skip testing for latest commit on pull request. `--comment "Reason for skipping build/test"` is required. IMPORTANT NOTE: This is dangerous since lack of user care and validation can cause top of tree to break.

### reuse-pipeline

`reuse-pipeline `

Reuse a previous pipeline to validate current commit. This action will also kill all currently running builds associated with the pull request. IMPORTANT NOTE: This is dangerous since lack of user care and validation can cause top of tree to break.
