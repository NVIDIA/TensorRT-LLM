# Scheduler

TensorRT-LLM PyTorch backend employs inflight batching, a mechanism where batching and scheduling occur dynamically at each LLM step.
The scheduler is invoked to determine which requests are scheduled at the current step.

## Scheduler Introduction

There are two kinds of schedulers:

- `CapacityScheduler`: This scheduler decides if resources should be allocated for each active request.
It considers the KV cache capacity and other resources, if applicable.
The input to `CapacityScheduler` includes all active requests that need processing.
The primary output is `fitting_requests`, representing the requests for which resources are reserved at the current step.
Another output is `paused_requests`, which supports request pausing in the C++ runtime.
- `MicroBatchScheduler`: This scheduler selects some requests from `fitting_requests` chosen by `CapacityScheduler`.
Another input is `inflight_request_ids`, which supports pipeline parallelism or overlapped execution in the C++ runtime.
Since PyTorch Flow does not support pipeline parallelism, `inflight_request_ids` is an empty set.
The outputs are `context_requests` and `generation_requests`, which are the scheduled context and generation requests.
Requests not in these lists are not selected for the model forward pass.

`SimpleScheduler` combines these two schedulers, first using `CapacityScheduler` and then `MicroBatchScheduler`, to get the final schedule result.
The inputs to `SimpleScheduler` include `active_requests` and `inflight_request_ids`, and the outputs are `context_requests`, `generation_requests`, and `paused_requests`.

## Customize Your Own Scheduler

To customize the scheduler or batching mechanism, implement your own `CapacityScheduler` and `MicroBatchScheduler` by inheriting their respective classes.
If two-step scheduling is unnecessary, inherit `RequestScheduler` and implement `schedule_request` directly.

An example of a `CapacityScheduler` implementation is the `GuaranteedNoEvictScheduler` class, found in [scheduler.py](../../../tensorrt_llm/_torch/pyexecutor/scheduler.py).
This class was used before the C++ binding of `CapacityScheduler` and initially employed a Python-based scheduler.
It inherits `CapacityScheduler` and implements its own `schedule_request` method.
This method processes all `active_requests` and tries to schedule more requests that can fit in the KV cache.
Resource estimation should align with resource allocation and deallocation in `kv_cache_manager`.

Here is the code snippet:

```python
class GuaranteedNoEvictScheduler(CapacityScheduler):
    # only schedule requests has no_schedule_until_state <= state < no_schedule_after_state
    no_schedule_until_state = LlmRequestState.CONTEXT_INIT
    no_schedule_after_state = LlmRequestState.GENERATION_COMPLETE

    def __init__(self, max_num_requests: int, kv_cache_manager):
        super(GuaranteedNoEvictScheduler, self).__init__()
        self.max_num_requests = max_num_requests
        self.kv_cache_manager = kv_cache_manager

    def schedule_request(
        self, active_requests: RequestList
    ) -> tuple[list[LlmRequest], list[LlmRequest]]:
        scheduled_requests = []
        pending_requests = []
        reserved_blocks = 0
        max_blocks = self.kv_cache_manager.get_max_resource_count()
        for request in active_requests:
            req_state = request.state
            # if request cannot be scheduled yet or request should no longer be scheduled, skip
            if req_state.value < self.no_schedule_until_state.value or req_state.value >= self.no_schedule_after_state.value:
                continue

            if len(scheduled_requests
                   ) >= self.max_num_requests or reserved_blocks >= max_blocks:
                break
            elif req_state == LlmRequestState.GENERATION_IN_PROGRESS or req_state == LlmRequestState.GENERATION_TO_COMPLETE:
                scheduled_requests.append(request)
                reserved_blocks += self.kv_cache_manager.get_needed_resource_to_completion(
                    request)
            else:
                pending_requests.append(request)

        avaiable_blocks = max_blocks - reserved_blocks
        for request in pending_requests:
            req_state = request.state
            if len(scheduled_requests) >= self.max_num_requests:
                break
            elif req_state == LlmRequestState.CONTEXT_INIT:
                needed_blocks = self.kv_cache_manager.get_needed_resource_to_completion(
                    request)
                if needed_blocks <= avaiable_blocks:
                    scheduled_requests.append(request)
                    avaiable_blocks -= needed_blocks
                elif needed_blocks > avaiable_blocks:
                    # If one requests fails to be scheduled, break
                    break

        assert len(scheduled_requests) > 0, (
            "no pending request can get enough resource to complete, "
            "please increase KV cache pool size.")
        return scheduled_requests, []
```

After implementing your own scheduler, integrate it into the PyExecutor.
For the PyTorch backend, the code is in [pytorch_model_registry.py](../../../tensorrt_llm/_torch/pyexecutor/backend_registries/pytorch_model_registry.py).
In the `create_pytorch_model_based_executor` function, there are two lines creating `CapacityScheduler`:

```python
    capacitor_scheduler = BindCapacityScheduler(max_num_requests,
                                                kv_cache_manager.impl)
```

Similar adjustments can be made for `MicroBatchScheduler`. This allows the `PyExecutor` to execute with your customized scheduling logic.
