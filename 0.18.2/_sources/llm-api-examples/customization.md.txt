# Common Customizations

## Quantization

TensorRT-LLM can quantize the Hugging Face model automatically. By setting the appropriate flags in the `LLM` instance. For example, to perform an Int4 AWQ quantization, the following code triggers the model quantization. Please refer to complete list of [supported flags](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/_modules/tensorrt_llm/quantization/mode.html#QuantAlgo) and acceptable values.

``` python
from tensorrt_llm.llmapi import QuantConfig, QuantAlgo

quant_config = QuantConfig(quant_algo=QuantAlgo.W4A16_AWQ)

llm = LLM(<model-dir>, quant_config=quant_config)
```

## Sampling

SamplingParams can customize the sampling strategy to control LLM generated responses, such as beam search, temperature, and [others](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/tensorrt_llm/llmapi/utils.py#L55-L76).

As an example, to enable beam search with a beam size of 4, set the `sampling_params` as follows:

```python
from tensorrt_llm.llmapi import LLM, SamplingParams, BuildConfig

build_config = BuildConfig()
build_config.max_beam_width = 4

llm = LLM(<llama_model_path>, build_config=build_config)
# Let the LLM object generate text with the default sampling strategy, or
# you can create a SamplingParams object as well with several fields set manually
sampling_params = SamplingParams(beam_width=4) # current limitation: beam_width should be equal to max_beam_width

for output in llm.generate(<prompt>, sampling_params=sampling_params):
    print(output)
```

`SamplingParams` manages and dispatches fields to C++ classes including:

* [SamplingConfig](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/_cpp_gen/runtime.html#_CPPv4N12tensorrt_llm7runtime14SamplingConfigE)
* [OutputConfig](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/_cpp_gen/executor.html#_CPPv4N12tensorrt_llm8executor12OutputConfigE)

Refer to the [class documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/llm-api/index.html#tensorrt_llm.llmapi.SamplingParams) for more details.

## Build Configuration

Apart from the arguments mentioned above, you can also customize the build configuration with the `build_config` class and other arguments borrowed from the trtllm-build CLI. These build configuration options provide flexibility in building engines for the target hardware and use cases. Refer to the following example:

```python
llm = LLM(<model-path>,
          build_config=BuildConfig(
            max_num_tokens=4096,
            max_batch_size=128,
            max_beam_width=4))
```
Refer to the [buildconfig documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/tensorrt_llm/builder.py#L470-L501) for more details.

## Runtime Customization

Similar to `build_config`, you can also customize the runtime configuration with the `runtime_config`, `peft_cache_config` or other [arguments](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/tensorrt_llm/llmapi/llm_utils.py#L186-L223) borrowed from the Executor APIs.  These runtime configuration options provide additional flexibility with respect to KV cache management, GPU memory allocation and so on. Refer to the following example:


```python
from tensorrt_llm.llmapi import LLM, KvCacheConfig

llm = LLM(<llama_model_path>,
          kv_cache_config=KvCacheConfig(
            free_gpu_memory_fraction=0.8))
```

## Tokenizer Customization

By default, the LLM API uses transformersâ€™ `AutoTokenizer`. You can override it with your own tokenizer by passing it when creating the LLM object. Refer to the following example:

```python
llm = LLM(<llama_model_path>, tokenizer=<my_faster_one>)
```

The LLM() workflow should use your tokenizer instead.

It is also possible to input token IDs directly without `Tokenizers` with the following code. The code produces token IDs without text because the tokenizer is not used.

``` python
llm = LLM(<llama_model_path>)

for output in llm.generate([32, 12]):
    ...
```

### Disable Tokenizer

For performance considerations, you can disable the tokenizer by passing `skip_tokenizer_init=True` when creating `LLM`. In this case, `LLM.generate` and `LLM.generate_async` will expect prompt token ids as input. Refer to the following example:

```python
llm = LLM(<llama_model_path>)
for output in llm.generate([[32, 12]], skip_tokenizer_init=True):
    print(output)
```

You will get something like:
```python
RequestOutput(request_id=1, prompt=None, prompt_token_ids=[1, 15043, 29892, 590, 1024, 338], outputs=[CompletionOutput(index=0, text='', token_ids=[518, 10858, 4408, 29962, 322, 306, 626, 263, 518, 10858, 20627, 29962, 472, 518, 10858, 6938, 1822, 306, 626, 5007, 304, 4653, 590, 4066, 297, 278, 518, 11947, 18527, 29962, 2602, 472], cumulative_logprob=None, logprobs=[])], finished=True)
```

Note that the `text` field in `CompletionOutput` is empty since the tokenizer is deactivated.

## Generation

### Asyncio-Based Generation

With the LLM API, you can also perform asynchronous generation with the `generate_async` method. Refer to the following example:

```python
llm = LLM(model=<llama_model_path>)

async for output in llm.generate_async(<prompt>, streaming=True):
    print(output)
```

When the `streaming` flag is set to `True`, the `generate_async` method will return a generator that yields each token as soon as it is available. Otherwise, it returns a generator that wait for and yields only the final results.

### Future-Style Generation

The result of the `generate_async` method is a [Future-like](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future) object, it doesn't block the thread unless the `.result()` is called.

```python
# This will not block the main thread
generation = llm.generate_async(<prompt>)
# Do something else here
# call .result() to explicitly block the main thread and wait for the result when needed
output = generation.result()
```

The `.result()` method works like the [result](https://docs.python.org/zh-cn/3/library/asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future.result) method in the Python Future, you can specify a timeout to wait for the result.

```python
output = generation.result(timeout=10)
```

There is an async version, where the `.aresult()` is used.

```python
generation = llm.generate_async(<prompt>)
output = await generation.aresult()
```
