      How this dependency is obtained:
        - submodule: Git submodules in 3rdparty/ directory
        - container: Pre-installed in the container image (e.g., PyTorch)
        - fetched: Downloaded from URL and built from source

      Directory path patterns (single or multi-directory).
      Supports exact consecutive component matching (no substring matching).

      Examples:
        - "pytorch" (single component: matches any path containing /pytorch/)
        - "3rdparty/cutlass" (multi-directory: matches /3rdparty/cutlass/ sequence)
        - "foo/bar/baz" (multi-directory: matches /foo/bar/baz/ sequence)

      Matching behavior:
        - Exact component match only (no substrings)
        - "foo/bar" matches "/home/foo/bar/file.h" ✓
        - "foo/bar" does NOT match "/home/foobar/file.h" ✗
        - "oo/ba" does NOT match "/foo/bar/file.h" ✗
        - Rightmost match wins if pattern appears multiple times in path
