# Cancelled-request id list never pruned — per-step O(n) scan grows for the life of the server

> Part of the [Scheduler & executor regression cookbook](index.md) · schema: [case-template](../case-template.md)

- **Provenance:** nvbug `5508267` · commit `f9380581c507` · PR #9280 —
  "[https://nvbugs/5508267][fix] Proper handling of inactive canceled requests".
- **Symptom:** a **gradual** slowdown of a long-running server under normal
  operation, root-caused per the NVBug to failed requests: each failed request
  was added to the list of canceled request ids and never removed from it, so
  the list grew longer with every failed request. Reported on DeepSeek 3.1 as
  performance degrading over time. **No metric number, model config or
  hardware is stated in the PR** — do not cite a magnitude for this case.
- **Root cause:** `canceled_req_ids` is a plain Python **list**, and the only
  removal path lived inside the `for request in self.active_requests` loop and
  fired only when `_try_cancel_request` succeeded. An id belonging to a request
  that was no longer in `active_requests` — i.e. every *failed* request — could
  therefore never be removed and leaked permanently. The unbounded list was then
  re-scanned linearly twice per iteration: the `req_id not in
  get_canceled_req_ids()` membership test, run once per active request
  (O(n_active × n_canceled) per call), and the same `not in` test inside
  `update_waiting_queue()`. There *was* an unconditional
  `clear_canceled_req_ids()` — but only under `if self.enable_attention_dp:`, so
  for every non-attention-DP configuration the leak was structural.
- **How introduced:** unknown — the PR names no culprit commit. This is
  as-shipped behaviour of the cancellation bookkeeping, not a regression from a
  previously faster state; it is a *degrade-over-time* bug, which is why it
  reached a customer rather than a perf bar (see Prevention/guard).
- **Fix mechanism:** stop removing entries and instead **rebuild** the list every
  call — collect the ids whose `_try_cancel_request` returned False into
  `still_pending_canceled_ids`, then `clear()` + `extend(...)`
  unconditionally, deleting the `enable_attention_dp`-only special case (and its
  "TODO: revisit the cancel logic of attention dp"). Separately the membership
  test is materialized once per call as a `set(...)`, so the residual scan is
  O(1) per request rather than O(n_canceled).
- **Detection signal:** the leak is visible as *drift*, not as a level, so
  compare a fresh server against the same server hours later at the same request
  rate. `_handle_canceled_requests` is already `@nvtx_range`-annotated in
  `tensorrt_llm/_torch/pyexecutor/py_executor.py`, so in an nsys capture that
  NVTX range's duration growing monotonically over wall-clock at flat request
  rate *is* the leaked list being rescanned. Static probe on a suspect commit:
  `grep -n 'canceled_req_ids' tensorrt_llm/_torch/pyexecutor/py_executor.py
  tensorrt_llm/_torch/pyexecutor/executor_request_queue.py` — a `clear` reachable
  only under an `enable_attention_dp` branch is the defect.
- **Prevention/guard:** **no guard added** — the PR ships no test and no bound or
  warning on `len(canceled_req_ids)`. That is the gap worth naming: any
  per-iteration container keyed by request lifetime should either be a `set` with
  an unconditional prune or carry a size assert/warning, because an unbounded
  one produces a *slope*, and perf CI measures *levels* in a fresh process — this
  class is invisible to every bar the project runs.
- **Generalizes to:** `pattern-host-work-on-hot-path`; carries to any
  per-step linear scan over a list whose pruning is conditional on a config flag,
  request-id bookkeeping in disagg/cancellation paths, degrade-over-time
  customer reports with no bisectable commit (look for monotonic growth, not a
  step), and `x in list` on the hot path where a `set` was intended.
