# Regression Cookbook — CUDA graph & compile

This module is the graph-capture and `torch.compile` machinery: the CUDA-graph
runner and its batch-size candidate list, the piecewise-CUDA-graph capture set
and the padding rule that maps a runtime shape onto a captured one, and the
compile gates that decide which regions are graphed at all
(`tensorrt_llm/_torch/compilation/`, `cuda_graph_runner.py`). Nothing here
computes a result — it decides *how* the same work is driven — so a defect is
almost never a slower kernel. It is a shape that no longer has a graph and
quietly runs eager, a shape that gets padded up to a far larger captured one,
or a compile wrapper whose host-side cost exceeds what graphing saves. First
thing to check: for the exact shapes the workload actually runs, was a graph
replayed, and which captured bucket did it land in.

## Recurring patterns in this module

- **Fast path silently fell back** — a capture set, an eligibility gate or a
  seeding predicate quietly routes a shape to eager. Nothing errors and the
  config is unchanged, so confirm replay per shape instead of trusting that
  graphs are "on". _(Instances: piecewise capture set missing reachable
  `num_tokens`; the mRoPE delta-cache seeding gate that keeps text-only decode
  permanently eager.)_
- **Padding bucket overshoot** — pad-to-nearest means a bucket far above its
  neighbour rounds the whole gap below it up to worst-case work, so **adding a
  bucket is not monotonically safe**. Check the distance between adjacent
  candidates, not just that the shape is covered.
  _(Instance: the force-appended piecewise capture ceiling.)_
- **Default change regressed a tuned workload** — flipping a default re-tunes
  every workload that was tuned against the old one; a config that named no
  batch-size list inherits the change silently.
  _(Instance: the changed CUDA-graph default batch sizes.)_
- **Host work on the hot path** — `torch.compile` on regions whose ops are too
  small to amortize guard/dispatch cost adds host time inside the piecewise
  region. Kernel names and durations are unchanged, so an nsys kernel diff finds
  nothing — compare the host spans.
  _(Instance: torch.compile on small MLA context ops.)_
