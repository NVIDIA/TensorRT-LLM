# Instability Cookbook — Measurement & test

This module is the **measurement apparatus itself**, not the product: the
perf-sanity harness and benchmark client under `tests/integration/defs/perf/`
(`test_perf_sanity.py`, the `parse_gen_worker_device_step_time` log parser, the
perf-DB `to_db_data()` / `to_match_keys()` bookkeeping) plus the test-side
determinism primitives it drives —
`TLLM_SPEC_DECODE_FORCE_NUM_ACCEPTED_TOKENS` and the synthetic-acceptance-rate
support in `tensorrt_llm/_torch/speculative/interface.py`. The compiled model in
every case here is stable; the number CI reports is not, either because the
metric summarises an RNG-coupled quantity or because the parser read a log the
writer had not finished flushing. These bugs are usually invisible in
single-node interactive runs and only appear under a scheduler, a cross-node
filesystem, or a suite-wide harness flag.

First thing to check: A/B the *measurement path* while holding the workload
fixed — one rep vs `--run-count`, single-node vs disagg, flag on vs off — and
compare the parsed iteration count against the run's expected iteration count
rather than comparing means.

## Recurring patterns in this module

- **Metric with hidden RNG** — the metric summarises a codepath that is not a
  pure function of its input. Spec-decode acceptance length is the canonical
  case: mean-of-N reads a different distribution every rep, so the regression
  gate flaps with no code change. The fix is a deterministic ground truth
  injected test-side (`TLLM_SPEC_DECODE_FORCE_NUM_ACCEPTED_TOKENS`, set per
  `server_config` in the yaml, plus fractional synthetic ARs so the forced mode
  can sit at the real operating point) with the CI baseline pinned to it.
  _(Instances: [force accepted-token count in spec-decode perf test](force-num-accepted-tokens-in-spec-perf-test.md),
  [fractional synthetic acceptance rates](fractional-synthetic-acceptance-rates.md),
  [`--ignore-eos` with spec decoding](ignore-eos-with-spec-decoding.md).)_
  The third instance is the inverse warning and the one to read first, because it
  needs no new knob to reproduce: a harness flag applied to *pin* one metric can
  randomize another. `--ignore-eos` is what makes plain-decode throughput
  comparable across reps by forcing every request to `osl` tokens, and it is
  exactly what destabilizes acceptance length, because past the natural EOS the
  draft model's agreement with the target is arbitrary. Before applying a
  suite-wide "make it deterministic" flag, ask which quantity the case actually
  measures — and record the flag in the perf DB's match keys so runs measured
  with and without it can never be compared.
- **Cross-node log-flush race** — the parser reads a log written on a different
  node and returns before the last decode iterations have drained. Fixed
  **twice on the same log**, and the pair is the lesson: round 1 polled until the
  usable-line count was stable across two reads, which a writer-owned
  `srun` aggregate fd can satisfy mid-flush — so the parser stopped raising and
  started silently averaging a partial run of iterations, turning a loud failure
  into a quiet bias. Round 2 replaced the heuristic with the writer's own
  end-of-write sentinel (a `gen_server_{i}.done` touched after the `srun` is
  reaped). Read them in order; the transferable rule is that a completeness
  check must come from the writer, not be inferred by the reader — and when you
  must infer, count rows, because a mean over a prefix looks plausible.
  _(Instances: [gen_only prev_device_step_time race](gen-only-prev-device-step-time-race.md) — round 1,
  [gen_only log-flush sentinel](gen-only-log-flush-sentinel.md) — round 2.)_

Retired from this module on 2026-08-12: **process-lifetime cache binds env** — an
`os.environ` read inside a `@cache`-decorated body resolves an env-controlled
configuration once per process, so later tests in the same pytest process cannot
flip it. The trap is real, but its only instance rested on four
functional nvbugs (5680911, 5698292, 5710045, 5758449) whose observable
was L0 unit tests silently no-op'ing, with no perf metric involved. Keep the
mechanism in mind when a knob "has no effect" in a directory-level sweep; do not
expect a case here.

## Cases

| Case | Symptom (signal) | Class |
|------|------------------|-------|
| [Force accepted-token count in spec-decode perf test](force-num-accepted-tokens-in-spec-perf-test.md) | QA Inference Time rows filed as regressions of +221.21 % / +51.94 % / +12.57 % against a 5 % regression bar, every attributed row `mtp3`; the same case reads +51.94 % in one release pair and +6.85 % in another | metric-with-hidden-rng |
| [Fractional synthetic acceptance rates](fractional-synthetic-acceptance-rates.md) | random-input spec-decode benchmarks report meaninglessly-low acceptance rates that move rep-to-rep on the same seed; integer-only forced ARs cannot reach the real operating point | metric-with-hidden-rng |
| [`--ignore-eos` forced generation past EOS in spec-decode cases](ignore-eos-with-spec-decoding.md) | acceptance rates unstable rep-to-rep at fixed config while throughput at fixed acceptance length is stable — no percentage, model or platform is stated anywhere, do not attach one | metric-with-hidden-rng |
| [gen_only disagg parser races NFS flush of the gen worker log](gen-only-prev-device-step-time-race.md) | intermittent `RuntimeError: … is missing 'prev_device_step_time' in gen_server_*.log`; the metric is never appended and the gate raises on a good run (round 1) | cross-node-log-flush-race |
| [gen_only log-flush sentinel](gen-only-log-flush-sentinel.md) | `mean_gen_worker_per_iter_device_step_time` silently averaged a truncated log with **no error raised**; 20 `disagg_upload-gen_only-*` cases waived on this mode alone (round 2, supersedes the row above) | cross-node-log-flush-race |
