Norman Lee, an artist for DC and Marvel comics, went missing while snorkeling with his wife off the eastern coast of Grand Cayman, CNN affiliate WCVB reported.

To his wife Jan, and his family and all his friends and fans that loved him, my sincerest condolences,\" friend and fellow graphic artist Chris Kinniery said on Facebook. \"I'm so sorry to hear about Norman Lee's disappearance.

Director Roland Emmerich will return to helm the film. \"Independence Day 2\" is set for release on June 24, 2016 — almost exactly 20 years from when the first film hit theaters on July 3, 1996. Dean Devlin, Emmerich and Harald Kloser are producing. Independence Day 2 is a big get for Usher, who will play a central character in the new film as the son of Smith's character. Smith's role in the first blockbuster helped establish him as a star, kicking his career up to the next level. Usher stars in the Lebron James-produced Starz TV series \"Survivor's Remorse\" as Cam Calloway, a basketball player who moves with his family to Atlanta after he signs a pro contract. The first season premiered Oct. 4, 2014, and Starz quickly renewed the show for a second season, which will air later this year. The rising star's film credits includes TriStar football drama When the Game Stands Tall, which hit theaters in August. On the TV side, he previously starred in the Cartoon Network's series Level Up.

Lakhvi, a top leader of the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, was not present at Friday's court proceeding. The terror attacks in India left more than 160 people dead in November 2008. In the attacks, heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around Mumbai, including luxury hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center. On Friday, India summoned the Pakistan high commissioner \"to convey our strong feelings about (the) Lakhvi verdict,\" said India's external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin. Last year, the court granted Lakhvi bail, a decision the Pakistani government had said it would challenge. Many in India are still angry over the attacks and had criticized the bail decision. \"It is very disappointing that the accused of the Mumbai attacks has been granted bail,\" the nation's home minister, Rajnath Singh, said in December. India executed the last surviving gunman from the attacks in 2012. Other suspects were all killed during the series of attacks, which went on for three days.

        "input": "(CNN)Closed for over a decade, a trail that's been described as \"the world's most dangerous path\" will no longer be off limits to the public thanks to a massive reconstruction project. Due to reopen March 26, Spain's stunning Caminito del Rey features a cliff face boardwalk that hangs 100 meters above the Guadalhorce River. The trail, which begins in the village of El Chorro in southern Malaga province, has been around since the early 1900s, originally built to provide access to two waterfalls for hydroelectric workers. Over the years, the boardwalk deteriorated and, following a string of fatal accidents in 1999 and 2000, the government demolished the access points to the walkway. The reopening, which comes over a year since reconstruction efforts kicked off, coincides with Spain's annual Holy Week celebrations. According to the Spanish daily El Pais, the provincial government allocated 5.5 million euros ($5.8 million) to the project. The entire route is 7.7 kilometers long, with boardwalks covering 2.9 kilometers of the trail. The most famous section includes the Balconcillo de los Gaitanes bridge, which spans the Gaitanes Gorge. Tourism officials say it takes between four and five hours to walk the entire route, which includes some steep slopes. Entry will be free for the first six months after the attraction reopens on March 26. Visiting hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. from April 1 to October 31, and 10 a.m.-2 p.m. from November 1 to March 31.
