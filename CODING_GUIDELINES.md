# TensorRT-LLM Coding Guidelines

## C++ Coding Guidelines

The TensorRT-LLM C++ Coding Guidelines are mainly derived from the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

------

#### Namespaces
1. Closing braces of namespaces should have a comment saying the namespace it closes:
```cpp
namespace foo
{
...
} // namespace foo
```

#### Constants
1. Prefer `const` or `constexpr` variables over `#defines` whenever possible, as the latter are not visible to the compiler.
2. A variable that is not modified after its initialization should be declared as `const`.
3. For naming of constants, see the Naming section of this document.

#### Literals (Recommendation)
1. Except `0`  (only used in comparison for checking signness/existence/emptiness) and `nullptr`, `true`, `false`, all other literals should only be used for variable initialization.
   Example:
```cpp
if (nbInputs == 2U){/*...*/}
```
   Should be changed to:
```cpp
constexpr size_t kNbInputsWBias = 2U;
if (nbInputs == kNbInputsWBias) {/*...*/}
```

#### Brace Notation
1. Use the [Allman indentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style) style.
2. Put the semicolon for an empty `for` or `while` loop in a new line.
3. The statement forming the body of a `switch`, `while`, `do .. while` or `for` statement shall be a compound statement. (use brace-delimited statements)
4. `If` and `else` should always be followed by brace-delimited statements, even if empty or a single statement.


#### Naming
1. Filenames
   * Camel case with first letter lowercase: `thisIsASubDir` and `thisIsAFilename.cpp`
   * *NOTE*: All files involved in the compilation of a compilation target (.exe/.so) must have filenames that are case-insensitive unique.

2. Types
   * All types (including, but not limited to, class names) are [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) with uppercase first letter. Example: `FooBarClass`

3. Local variables, methods and namespaces
   * Camel case with first letter lowercase. Example: `localFooBar`

4. Non-magic-number global variables that are non-static and not defined in anonymous namespace
   * Camel case prefixed by a lower case 'g'. Example: `gDontUseGlobalFoos`

5. Non-magic-number global variables that are static or defined in an anonymous namespace
   * Camel case prefixed by a lower case  's'. Example: `sMutableStaticGlobal`

6. Locally visible static variable
   * Camel case with lowercase prefix ''s" as the first letter of the name. Example: `static std::once_flag sFlag;`

7. Public, private and protected class member variables
   * Camelcase prefixed with an 'm': `mNbFooValues`.
   * Public member variables do not require the 'm' prefix but it is highly encouraged to use the prefix when needed to improve code clarity, especially in cases where the class is a base class in an inheritance chain.

8. Constants
   * Enumerations, global constants, static constants at class-scope and function-scope magic-number/literal constants are uppercase snakecase with prefix 'k':
```cpp
int const kDIGIT_NUM = 10;
```
> *NOTE*: Function-scope constants that are not magic numbers or literals are named like non-constant variables:
```cpp
bool const pass = a && b;
```

9. Macros
   * See [Constants](CODING-GUIDELINES.md#constants), which are preferred over `#define`.
   * If you must use macros, however, follow uppercase snakecase: `FOO_VERSION`

Notes:
* In general don't use [hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation), except for 'apps hungarian' in some cases such as 'nb' in a variable name to indicate count: `mNbLayers`
* If a constructor's parameter name `foo` conflicts with a public member name `foo`, add a trailing underscore to the parameter name: `foo_`.
* Literal suffixes should be upper case. For example, use `1234L` instead of `1234l`.


#### Tabs vs Spaces
1. Use only spaces. Do not use tabs.
2. Indent 4 spaces at a time. This is enforced automatically if you format your code using our clang-format config.


#### Formatting
1. Use the [LLVM clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) tool for formatting your changes prior to submitting the PR.
2. Use a maximum of 120 characters per line. The auto formatting tool will wrap longer lines.
3. Exceptions to formatting violations must be justified on a per-case basis. Bypassing the formatting rules is discouraged, but can be achieved for exceptions as follows:
```cpp
// clang-format off
// .. Unformatted code ..
// clang-format on
```

#### Pointers and Memory Allocation
1. Use smart pointers for allocating objects on the heap.
2. When picking a smart pointer, prefer `unique_ptr` for single resource ownership and `shared_ptr` for shared resource ownership. Use `weak_ptr` only in exceptional cases.
3. Do not use smart pointers that have been deprecated in C++11.


#### Comments
1. C++ comments are required. C comments are not allowed except for special cases (inline).
2. C++ style for single-line comments. `// This is a single line comment`
3. In function calls where parameters are not obvious from inspection, it can be helpful to use an inline C comment to document the parameter for readers:
```cpp
doSomeOperation(/* checkForErrors = */ false);
```
4. If the comment is a full sentence, it should be capitalized i.e. start with capital letter and punctuated properly.
5. Follow [Doxygen rules](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) for documenting new class interfaces and function prototypes.
* For C++-style single-line comments use `//!`.
* For class members, use `//!<`.
```cpp
//! This is a Doxygen comment
//! in C++ style

struct Foo
{
    int x; //!< This is a Doxygen comment for members
}
```

#### Disabling Code
1. Use `#if` / `#endif` to disable code, preferably with a mnemonic condition like this:
```cpp
#if DEBUG_FEATURE
// ...code to be disabled...
#endif
```

```cpp
// Alternative: use a macro which evaluates to a noop in release code.
#if DEBUG_FEATURE
# define DEBUG_FEAT_CODE(x) x
#else
# define DEBUG_FEAT_CODE(x)
#endif
```

2. Avoid dead code.

```cpp
const bool gDisabledFeature = false;

void foo()
{
   if (gDisabledFeature)
   {
       doSomething();
   }
}
```

3. Do NOT use comments to disable code. Use comments to explain code, not hide it.


#### Exceptions
1.  Exceptions must not be thrown across library boundaries.


#### Casts
1. Use the least forceful cast necessary, or no cast if possible, to help the compiler diagnose unintended consequences.
2. Casting a pointer to a `void*` should be implicit (except if removing `const`).
3. Casting should not remove any `const` or `volatile` qualification from the type of a pointer or reference.
4. Do not use C-style casts (other than void casts) and functional notation casts (other than explicit constructor calls).
6. Casting from a `void*` to a `T*` should be done with `static_cast`, not `reinterpret_cast`, since the latter is more forceful.
7. Use `reinterpret_cast` as a last resort, where `const_cast` and `static_cast` won't work.
8. Avoid `dynamic_cast`.


#### Expressions
1. Do not use assignment operator in subexpressions.
```cpp
// Not compliant
x = y = z;

// Not compliant
if (x = y)
{
    // ...
}
```

#### Statements
1. When practical, a `switch` statement controlled by an `enum` should have a case for each enum value and not have a default clause so that we get a compile-time error if a new enum value is added.
2. Switch statements should be well structured.  An informal guideline is to treat switch statements as structured multi-way branches and not "glorified gotos" such as:
```cpp
// Not compliant
switch (x) case 4: if (y) case 5: return 0; else default: return 1;
```
3. The "well structured" requirement prohibits fall-though except from one case label to another.   Each case clause must be terminated in a break or throw.  If a case clause has multiple statements, the braces are optional.  The following example illustrates these requirements:
```cpp
switch (x)
{
case 0:         // Fall-through allowed from case 0: to case 1: since case 0 is empty.
case 1:
    a();
    b();
    break;
case 2:
case 4:
{              // With optional braces
    c();
    d();
    break;
}
case 5:
    c();
    throw 42;  // Terminating with throw is okay
default:
    throw 42;
}
```

4. Ending a case clause with return is not allowed.
5. If a switch clause is a compound statement, put the break inside the braces.
```cpp
switch (x)
{
case 0:
case 1:
{
    y();
    z();
    break;
}
...other cases...
}
```

#### Functions
1. Avoid declaring large functions as `inline`, absent a quantifiable benefit.  Remember that functions defined in class declarations are implicitly inline.
2. Rather than using the `static` keyword to mark a function as having internal linkage, prefer to use anonymous namespaces instead.
3. Every defined function must be called at least once. That is, do not have unused methods.
4. Parameter names should be consistent across function definition and corresponding function declarations.


#### Structures and Classes
1. All class templates, function templates, class template member functions and class template static members shall be instantiated at least once. This prevents use of uninitialized variables.
2. If class is not a *Plain Old Data Structure*, then its data members should be private.


#### Preprocessor Directives
1. `#define` and `#undef` of macros should be done only at global namespace.
2. Avoid the use of `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` directives (except in the case of header include guards). Prefer to use `#if defined(...)` or `#if !defined(...)` instead. The latter syntax is more consistent with C syntax, and allows you to use more complicated preprocessor conditionals, e.g.:
```cpp
#if defined(FOO) || defined(BAR)
void foo();
#endif // defined(FOO) || defined(BAR)
```

3. When nesting preprocessor directives, use indentation after the hash mark (#). For example:
```cpp
#if defined(FOO)
# if FOO == 0
#  define BAR 0
# elif FOO == 1
#  define BAR 5
# else
#  error "invalid FOO value"
# endif
#endif
```

4. Use a preprocessor guard. It's standard-conforming and modern compilers are smart enough to open the file only once.
   * The guard name must have prefix `TRTLLM_` followed by the filename, all in caps. For a header file named `FooBarHello.h`, name the symbol as `TRTLLM_FOO_BAR_HELLO_H`.
   * Only use the file name to create the symbol. Unlike the Google C++ guideline, we do not include the directory names in the symbol. This is because we ensure all filenames are unique in the compilation unit.
   * Do not use prefix with underscore. Such symbols are reserved in C++ standard for compilers or implementation.
   * Do not use trailing underscore for the symbol. We differ in this from Google C++ guideline, which uses trailing underscore: `TRTLLM_FOO_BAR_HELLO_H_`
```cpp
#ifndef TRTLLM_FOO_BAR_HELLO_H
#define TRTLLM_FOO_BAR_HELLO_H
// ...
#endif // TRTLLM_FOO_BAR_HELLO_H
```


#### Signed vs Unsigned Integers
1. Use signed integers instead of unsigned, except for the cases below.
* The integer is a bitmap - use an unsigned type, since sign extension could lead to surprises.
* The integer is being used with an external library that expects an unsigned integer.  A common example is a loop that compares against `std::vector::size()`, such as:
```cpp
for (size_t i = 0; i < mTensors.size(); ++i) // preferred style
```
* Using only signed integers for the above would lead to prolixity and perhaps unsafe narrowing:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < static_cast<int>(mTensors.size()); ++i)
```

#### Common Pitfalls

1. C headers should not be used directly.
   - Example: Use `<cstdint>` instead of  `<stdint.h>`
2. Do not use C library functions, whenever possible.
   * Use brace initialization or `std::fill_n()` instead of `memset()`. This is especially important when dealing with non-[POD types](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/PODType). In the example below, using `memset()` will corrupt the vtable of `Foo:`
```cpp
struct Foo {
    virtual int getX() { return x; }
    int x;
};
...

// Bad: use memset() to initialize Foo
{
    Foo foo;
    memset(&foo, 0, sizeof(foo)); // Destroys hidden virtual-function-table pointer!
}
// Good: use brace initialization to initialize Foo
{
    Foo foo = {};
}
```

2. When specifying pointers to `const` data, the pointer itself may be `const`, in some usecases.
```cpp
char const * const errStr = getErrorStr(status);
```

## Appendix

####  Abbreviation Words and Compound Words as Part of Names

* Abbreviation words, which are usually fully-capitalized in literature, are treated as normal words without special capitalization, e.g. `gpuAllocator`, where GPU is converted to `gpu` before constructing the camel case name.
* Compound words, which are usually used in full in literature, e.g. `runtime`, can be abbreviated into fully capitalized letters, e.g. `RT`.

####  Terminology

* *CUDA code* is code that must be compiled with a CUDA compiler. Typically, it includes:
   * Declaration or definition of global or static variables with one of the following CUDA keywords: `__device__`, `__managed__` and `__constant__`.
   * Declaration or definition of device functions decorated with `__device__`.
   * Declaration or definition of kernels decorated with `__global__`.
   * Kernel launching with <<<...>>> syntax.

> NOTE:
   * Definition of kernel function pointer type aliases is not device code, e.g. `typedef __global__ void(*KernelFunc)(void* /*arg*/);`.
   * Definition of pointers to kernel functions is not device code, either, e.g. `__global__ void(*KernelFunc)(void* /*arg*/) = getKernelFunc(parameters);` .
   * Kernel launching with the CUDA runtime/driver API's, e.g. `cuLaunch` and `cudaLaunch`, is not CUDA code.

## Python Coding Guidelines
#### Python Standard
1. The code developed for TensorRT-LLM should conform to Python 3.8+.

#### Indentation
1. Indent code with 4 spaces. Do not use tabs.

#### Imports
1. Always maintain the namespace when importing, even if only one class or function from a module is used.

For example instead of:

```python
from package.subpackage.foo import SomeClass
SomeClass()
```
or
```python
import package
package.subpackage.foo.SomeClass()
```

Do:

```python
from package.subpackage import foo
foo.SomeClass()
```

#### Naming

##### Identifier Format
1. Files
- snake_case: `some_file.py`

2. Classes
- PascalCase: `class SomeClass`

3. Functions and Methods
- snake_case: `def my_awesome_function():`

4. Local Variables
- snake_case: `my_variable = ...`
- prefix `k` for variable names that start with a number: `k_99th_percentile = ...`

5. Global Variables
- upper snake_case and prefix `G`: `G_MY_GLOBAL = ...`

6. Constants
- upper snake_case: `MY_CONSTANT = ...`

##### Identifier Guidelines
1. Avoid shadowing variables declared in an outer scope.
2. Initialize all externally visible memberes of a class in the constructor.

#### Comments

1. For interfaces that may be used outside a file, prefer docstrings over comments.
2. Comments should be reserved for code within a function, or interfaces that are local to a file.

#### Docstring Syntax
##### Classes and Functions
Use the [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), which can be parsed by Sphinx.

#####  Attributes and Variables
Attributes and variables can be documented inline. Attribute docstrings will be rendered under the docstring for the class. For example:
```python
class MyClass:
    """
    Description of the class.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 5
        """<type>: Description of 'x'"""

y = 2
"""<type>: Description of 'y'"""
```

#### Avoid Reflection
Avoid using reflection when functionality can be easily achieved without reflection.

For example, instead of:

```python
def make_complex(*args):
    x, y = args
    return dict(**locals())
```

Do:

```python
def make_complex(x, y):
    return {'x': x, 'y': y}
```

#### Error Handling
1. When using try-except blocks, limit the except to the smallest set of errors possible.

For example, instead of:

```python
try:
    open(path, "r").read()
except:
    print("Failed to open file")
```

Do:

```python
try:
    open(path, "r").read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Failed to open file")
```


2. When using try-except blocks to handle multiple possible variable types (i.e. duck-typing), keep the body of the try as small as possible, using the else block to implement the logic.

For example, instead of:

```python
try:
    f.seek(0)
    f.read()
except AttributeError:
    ... # Not a file-like object, do something else
```

Do:

```python
try:
    f.seek # Do not call to minimize chance of unrelated failure
except AttributeError:
    ... # Not a file-like object, do something else
else:
    f.seek(0)
    f.read()
```
