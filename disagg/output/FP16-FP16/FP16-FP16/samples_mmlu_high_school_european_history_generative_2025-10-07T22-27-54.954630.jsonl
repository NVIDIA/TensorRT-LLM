{"doc_id": 106, "doc": {"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nWhat was the primary impact of \"Humanism ceas[ing] to be the exclusive privilege of the few\"?", "subject": "high_school_european_history", "choices": ["The populous demanded rights from the state.", "People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.", "Latin replaced many of the vulgar languages throughout Europe.", "European literature stagnated due to widespread interest in the writings of antiquity."], "answer": 1}, "target": "B", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school european history.\n\nThis question refers to the following information.\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea.

Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n—Vladimir I.

To organize Peace Offices on the estates of the nobles, leaving the village communes as they are, and to open cantonal offices in the large villages and unite small village communes.\n4. To formulate, verify, and confirm in each village commune or estate a charter which will specify, on the basis of local conditions, the amount of land allotted to the peasants for permanent use, and the scope of their obligations to the nobleman for the land.\n6. Until that time, peasants and household serfs must be obedient towards their nobles, and scrupulously fulfill their former obligations.\n7. The nobles will continue to keep order on their estates, with the right of jurisdiction and of police, until the organization of cantons and of cantonal courts.\n—Alexander II, \"The Abolition of Serfdom in Russia,\" Manifesto of February 19, 1861\nWhich of the following best articulates the new conditions for the recently emancipated serfs of Russia as stated in the above passage?\nA. The tsar's manifesto allowed for a heterogeneous class of farmers to emerge, with many former serfs becoming quite prosperous while others struggled.\nB. The manifesto was mostly ineffective in improving the economic condition of former serfs, but paved the way for local self-rule and, soon after, a national legislature.\nC. The tsar's insistence on cooperation between the nobility and recently emancipated people limited the financial potential of all impacted by the manifesto.\nD. The manifesto, although emancipating the serfs, saddled them with financial responsibilities and other restrictions, while the aristocracy retained too many of their former rights.\nAnswer:", "arg_1": {"until": ["</s>", "\n"]}}}, "resps": [[" D"]], "filtered_resps": ["D"], "filter": "get_response", "metrics": ["exact_match"], "doc_hash": "3443b143127eda8084912fd15c8c4a71d3f89889b29ff50fb97a37ff2a68c243", "prompt_hash": "070b9887af4da3e5e7f1886147b3cd90f3decd75ad4f3334816325893d11e069", "target_hash": "3f39d5c348e5b79d06e842c114e6cc571583bbf44e4b0ebfda1a01ec05745d43", "exact_match": 1.0}
