## Prerequisite

First, please download Deepseek-v2 weights from HF https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2.

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2
```

## Hardware

The Deepseek-v2 model requires least 8x80G GPU memory, model contains 236B parameters roughly 472GB memory (with BF16 precision).

***Caution: Current TRT-LLM MLA kernel only support Hopper architecture (SM90). Ampere architecture (SM80 & SM86) will be supported in next release.***

## Overview

The TensorRT-LLM Deepseek-v2 implementation can be found in [tensorrt_llm/models/deepseek_v2/model.py](../../tensorrt_llm/models/deepseek_v2/model.py). The TensorRT-LLM Deepseek-v2 example code is located in [`example/deepseek_v2`](./). There is one main file:

* [`convert_checkpoint.py`](./convert_checkpoint.py) to convert the Deepseek-v2 model into tensorrt-llm checkpoint format.

In addition, there are three shared files in the parent folder [`examples`](../) can be used for inference and evaluation:

* [`../run.py`](../run.py) to run the model inference output by given an input text.
* [`../summarize.py`](../summarize.py) to summarize the article from [cnn_dailmail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail) dataset, it can running the summarize from HF model and TensorRT-LLM model.
* [`../mmlu.py`](../mmlu.py) to running score script from https://github.com/declare-lab/instruct-eval to compare HF model and TensorRT-LLM model on the MMLU dataset.

## Support Matrix

- [x] BF16
- [ ] FP8

***Caution: prefer using BF16 over FP16 for Deepseek-v2 since model original training precision is BF16 and we found direct convert BF16 -> FP16 will suffer accuracy drop.***

## Usage

The TensorRT-LLM Deepseek-v2 example code locates at [examples/deepseek_v2](./). It takes PyTorch weights as input, and builds corresponding TensorRT engines. The number of TensorRT engines depends on the number of GPUs used to run inference.

### Build TensorRT engine(s)

Below is the step-by-step to run Deepseek-v2 with TensorRT-LLM.

First the checkpoint will be converted to the TensorRT-LLM checkpoint format by apply [`convert_checkpoint.py`](./convert_checkpoint.py). After that, the TensorRT engine(s) can be build with TensorRT-LLM checkpoint.

```bash
# Convert Deepseek-v2 HF weights to TensorRT-LLM checkpoint format.
python convert_checkpoint.py --model_dir ./DeepSeek-V2 \
                            --output_dir ./trtllm_checkpoint_deepseek_v2_8gpu_bf16 \
                            --dtype bfloat16 \
                            --tp_size 8

# With '--load_model_on_cpu' option if total GPU memory is insufficient
python convert_checkpoint.py --model_dir ./DeepSeek-V2 \
                            --output_dir ./trtllm_checkpoint_deepseek_v2_cpu_bf16 \
                            --dtype bfloat16 \
                            --tp_size 8 \
                            --load_model_on_cpu
```


We observe use GPUs(8xH200) the checkpoint conversion time took ~ 34 mints, while use CPUs took ~ 21 mints and CPU memory required >= 770GB.

After the checkpoint conversion, the TensorRT engine(s) can be built with the TensorRT-LLM checkpoint.

```bash
# Build engine
trtllm-build --checkpoint_dir ./trtllm_checkpoint_deepseek_v2_8gpu_bf16 \
            --output_dir ./trtllm_engines/deepseek_v2/bf16/tp8-sel4096-isl2048-bs4 \
            --gpt_attention_plugin bfloat16 \
            --gemm_plugin bfloat16 \
            --max_batch_size 4 \
            --max_seq_len 4096 \
            --max_input_len 2048 \
            --use_paged_context_fmha enable
```

***Caution: `--max_batch_size` and `--max_seq_len` are the main factors to determine how many GPU memory will be used during runtime, so later when try to run e.g., `summarize.py` or `mmlu.py` or `gptManagerBenchmark.cpp`may need adjust `--max_batch_size` and `--max_seq_len` accordingly to avoid OOM.(meaning rebuild TensorRT engine with smaller `--max_batch_size` and `--max_seq_len` if needed based on GPU memory size), there is beautiful technical log perf-best-practices.md (https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docs/source/performance/perf-best-practices.md) explained the mechanism.***

Test the engine with [run.py](../run.py) script:

```bash
mpirun --allow-run-as-root -n 8 python ../run.py --engine_dir ./trtllm_engines/deepseek_v2/bf16/tp8-sel4096-isl2048-bs4 \
                --tokenizer_dir ./DeepSeek-V2 \
                --max_output_len 40 \
                --input_text "The president of the United States is person who"
```

and the output will be like:

If we want to evaluate the model summarization ability, we can use [summarize.py](../summarize.py) script:

```bash
mpirun --allow-run-as-root -n 8 python ../summarize.py --engine_dir ./trtllm_engines/deepseek_v2/bf16/tp8-sel4096-isl2048-bs4 \
                       --hf_model_dir ./DeepSeek-V2 \
                       --data_type bfloat16 \

                       --test_trt_llm \
                       --test_hf
```

and the output will be like:

[10/28/2024-16:46:22] [TRT-LLM] [I]  Input : ['(CNN)James Best, best known for his portrayal of bumbling sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on TV\'s "The Dukes of Hazzard," died Monday after a brief illness. He was 88. Best died in hospice in Hickory, North Carolina, of complications from pneumonia, said Steve Latshaw, a longtime friend and Hollywood colleague. Although he\'d been a busy actor for decades in theater and in Hollywood, Best didn\'t become famous until 1979, when "The Dukes of Hazzard\'s" cornpone charms began beaming into millions of American homes almost every Friday night. For seven seasons, Best\'s Rosco P. Coltrane chased the moonshine-running Duke boys back and forth across the back roads of fictitious Hazzard County, Georgia, although his "hot pursuit" usually ended with him crashing his patrol car. Although Rosco was slow-witted and corrupt, Best gave him a childlike enthusiasm that got laughs and made him endearing. His character became known for his distinctive "kew-kew-kew" chuckle and for goofy catchphrases such as "cuff \'em and stuff \'em!" upon making an arrest. Among the most popular shows on TV in the early \'80s, "The Dukes of Hazzard" ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies, an animated series and video games. Several of Best\'s "Hazzard" co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media. "I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year," co-star John Schneider, who played Bo Duke, said on Twitter. "Give Uncle Jesse my love when you see him dear friend." "Jimmy Best was the most constantly creative person I have ever known," said Ben Jones, who played mechanic Cooter on the show, in a Facebook post. "Every minute of his long life was spent acting, writing, producing, painting, teaching, fishing, or involved in another of his life\'s many passions." Born Jewel Guy on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, Best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by Armen and Essa Best, who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana. Best served in the Army during World War II before launching his acting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, he accumulated scores of credits, playing a range of colorful supporting characters in such TV shows as "The Twilight Zone," "Bonanza," "The Andy Griffith Show" and "Gunsmoke." He later appeared in a handful of Burt Reynolds\' movies, including "Hooper" and "The End." But Best will always be best known for his "Hazzard" role, which lives on in reruns. "Jimmie was my teacher, mentor, close friend and collaborator for 26 years," Latshaw said. "I directed two of his feature films, including the recent \'Return of the Killer Shrews,\' a sequel he co-wrote and was quite proud of as he had made the first one more than 50 years earlier." People we\'ve lost in 2015 . CNN\'s Stella Chan contributed to this story.']
