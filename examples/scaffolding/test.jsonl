{"id":68,"problem":"Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.","solution":"Let's first try some experimentation. Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are $3$, Alice will take $1$, Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are $4$, Alice will just remove all $4$ at once. If there are $5$, no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are $1$, $3$, or $4$ coins left. Bob wins if there are $2$ or $5$ coins left.\nAfter some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If there is n is a multiple of $5$, then Bob will win. The reason for this is the following: Let's say there are a multiple of $5$ coins remaining in the stack. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. This process will continue until you get $0$ coins left. For example, let's say there are $205$ coins. No matter what Alice does, Bob can simply just do the complement. After each of them make a turn, there will always be a multiple of $5$ left. This will continue until there are $5$ coins left, and Bob will end up winning.\nAfter some more experimentation, you'll realize that any number that is congruent to $2$ mod $5$ will also work. This is because Bob can do the same strategy, and when there are $2$ coins left, Alice is forced to take $1$ and Bob takes the final coin. For example, let's say there are $72$ coins. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$. So after they each make a turn, the number will always be equal to $2$ mod $5$. Eventually, there will be only $2$ coins remaining, and we've established that Alice will simply take $1$ and Bob will take the final coin.\nSo we have to find the number of numbers less than or equal to $2024$ that are either congruent to $0$ mod $5$ or $2$ mod $5$. There are $404$ numbers in the first category: $5, 10, 15, \\dots, 2020$. For the second category, there are $405$ numbers. $2, 7, 12, 17, \\dots, 2022$. So the answer is $404 + 405 = \\boxed{809}$\n~lprado\nWe will use winning and losing positions, where a $W$ marks when Alice wins and an $L$ marks when Bob wins.\n$1$ coin: $W$\n$2$ coins: $L$\n$3$ coins: $W$\n$4$ coins: $W$\n$5$ coins: $L$\n$6$ coin: $W$\n$7$ coins: $L$\n$8$ coins: $W$\n$9$ coins: $W$\n$10$ coins: $L$\n$11$ coin: $W$\n$12$ coins: $L$\n$13$ coins: $W$\n$14$ coins: $W$\n$15$ coins: $L$\nWe can see that losing positions occur when $n$ is congruent to $0, 2 \\mod{5}$ and winning positions occur otherwise. In other words, there will be $2$ losing positions out of every $5$ consecutive values of n. As $n$ ranges from $1$ to $2020$, $\\frac{2}{5}$ of these values are losing positions where Bob will win. As $n$ ranges from $2021$ to $2024$, $2022$ is the only value where Bob will win. Thus, the answer is $2020\\times\\frac{2}{5}+1=\\boxed{809}$\n~alexanderruan\nDenote by $A_i$ and $B_i$ Alice's or Bob's $i$th moves, respectively.\nCase 1: $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nBob can always take the strategy that $B_i = 5 - A_i$.\nThis guarantees him to win.\nIn this case, the number of $n$ is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404$.\nCase 2: $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\nIn this case, consider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 1$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$.\nThus, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\nCase 3: $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\nIn this case, consider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 4$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$.\nThus, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\nCase 4: $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\nBob can always take the strategy that $B_i = 5 - A_i$.\nTherefore, after the $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor$th turn, there are two tokens leftover.\nTherefore, Alice must take 1 in the next turn that leaves the last token on the table.\nTherefore, Bob can take the last token to win the game.\nThis guarantees him to win.\nIn this case, the number of $n$ is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor +1 = 405$.\nCase 5: $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$.\nConsider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 1$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$.\nBy doing so, there will finally be 2 tokens on the table and Bob moves first. Because Bob has the only choice of taking 1 token, Alice can take the last token and win the game.\nTherefore, in this case, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\nPutting all cases together, the answer is $404 + 405 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(809) }}$.\nSince the game Alice and Bob play is impartial (the only difference between player 1 and player 2 is that player 1 goes first (note that games like chess are not impartial because each player can only move their own pieces)), we can use the Sprague-Grundy Theorem to solve this problem. We will use induction to calculate the Grundy Values for this game.\nWe claim that heaps of size congruent to $0,2 \\bmod{5}$ will be in outcome class $\\mathcal{P}$ (win for player 2 = Bob), and heaps of size equivalent to $1,3,4 \\bmod{5}$ will be in outcome class $\\mathcal{N}$ (win for player 1 = Alice).

The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.","solution":"This is a conditional probability problem. Bayes' Theorem states that \n\\[P(A|B)=\\dfrac{P(B|A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n\nin other words, the probability of $A$ given $B$ is equal to the probability of $B$ given $A$ times the probability of $A$ divided by the probability of $B$. In our case, $A$ represents the probability of winning the grand prize, and $B$ represents the probability of winning a prize. Clearly, $P(B|A)=1$, since by winning the grand prize you automatically win a prize. Thus, we want to find $\\dfrac{P(A)}{P(B)}$.\nLet us calculate the probability of winning a prize. We do this through casework: how many of Jen's drawn numbers match the lottery's drawn numbers? \nTo win a prize, Jen must draw at least $2$ numbers identical to the lottery. Thus, our cases are drawing $2$, $3$, or $4$ numbers identical. \nLet us first calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $2$ identical numbers to the lottery. Let Jen choose the numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$; we have $\\dbinom42$ ways to choose which $2$ of these $4$ numbers are identical to the lottery. We have now determined $2$ of the $4$ numbers drawn in the lottery; since the other $2$ numbers Jen chose can not be chosen by the lottery, the lottery now has $10-2-2=6$ numbers to choose the last $2$ numbers from. Thus, this case is $\\dbinom62$, so this case yields $\\dbinom42\\dbinom62=6\\cdot15=90$ possibilities. \nNext, let us calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $3$ identical numbers to the lottery. Again, let Jen choose $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. This time, we have $\\dbinom43$ ways to choose the identical numbers and again $6$ numbers left for the lottery to choose from; however, since $3$ of the lottery's numbers have already been determined, the lottery only needs to choose $1$ more number, so this is $\\dbinom61$. This case yields $\\dbinom43\\dbinom61=4\\cdot6=24$. \nFinally, let us calculate the number of ways to all $4$ numbers matching. There is actually just one way for this to happen. \nIn total, we have $90+24+1=115$ ways to win a prize. The lottery has $\\dbinom{10}4=210$ possible combinations to draw, so the probability of winning a prize is $\\dfrac{115}{210}$. There is actually no need to simplify it or even evaluate $\\dbinom{10}4$ or actually even know that it has to be $\\dbinom{10}4$; it suffices to call it $a$ or some other variable, as it will cancel out later. However, let us just go through with this. The probability of winning a prize is $\\dfrac{115}{210}$. Note that the probability of winning a grand prize is just matching all $4$ numbers, which we already calculated to have $1$ possibility and thus have probability $\\dfrac1{210}$.

If you go up first, you will end on the side opposite to it (the right side) and if you go right first, you will end up on the top. It can then be observed that if you choose the turning points in the middle $7 \\times 7$ grid, that will automatically determine your start and ending points. For example, in the diagram if you choose the point $(3,2)$ and $(5,3)$, you must first move three up or two right, determining your first point, and move 5 up or 3 right, determining your final point. Knowing this is helpful because if we first move anywhere horizontally, we have $7$ points on each column to choose from and starting from left to right, we have $6,5,4,3,2,1$ points on that row to choose from. This gives us $7(6)+7(5)+7(4)+7(3)+7(2)+7(1)$ which simplifies to $7\\cdot21$. The vertical case is symmetrical so we have $7\\cdot21\\cdot2 = \\boxed{294}$\n~KEVIN_LIU\nAs in Solution 1, there are two cases: $RURUR$ or $URURU$. We will work with the first case and multiply by $2$ at the end. We use stars and bars; we can treat the $R$s as the stars and the $U$s as the bars. However, we must also use stars and bars on the $U$s to see how many different patterns of bars we can create for the reds. We must have $1$ bar in $8$ blacks, so we use stars and bars on the equation \\[x + y = 8\\]. However, each divider must have at least one black in it, so we do the change of variable $x' = x-1$ and $y' = x-1$. Our equation becomes \\[x' + y' = 6\\]. By stars and bars, this equation has $\\binom{6 + 2 - 1}{1} = 7$ valid solutions. Now, we use stars and bars on the reds. We must distribute two bars amongst the reds, so we apply stars and bars to \\[x + y + z = 8\\]. Since each group must have one red, we again do a change of variables with $x' = x-1$, $y' = y-1$, and $z' = z-1$. We are now working on the equation \\[x' + y' + z' = 5\\]. By stars and bars, this has $\\binom{5 + 3 - 1}{2} = 21$ solutions. The number of valid paths in this case is the number of ways to create the bars times the number of valid arrangements of the stars given fixed bars, which equals $21 \\cdot 7 = 147$.

We can use elementary calculus for this, but to do so, we must put the expression in terms of one variable. Recall that $a^2+b^2=16$; thus, $b=\\pm\\sqrt{16-a^2}$. Notice that we have a $-108b$ in the expression; to maximize the expression, we want $b$ to be negative so that $-108b$ is positive and thus contributes more to the expression. We thus let $b=-\\sqrt{16-a^2}$. Let $f(a)=81a-108b$. We now know that $f(a)=81a+108\\sqrt{16-a^2}$, and can proceed with normal calculus. \n\\begin{align*}\nf(a)&=81a+108\\sqrt{16-a^2} \\\\\n&=27\\left(3a+4\\sqrt{16-a^2}\\right) \\\\\nf'(a)&=27\\left(3a+4\\sqrt{16-a^2}\\right)' \\\\\n&=27\\left(3+4\\left(\\sqrt{16-a^2}\\right)'\\right) \\\\\n&=27\\left(3+4\\left(\\dfrac{-2a}{2\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&=27\\left(3-4\\left(\\dfrac a{\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&=27\\left(3-\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right). \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe want $f'(a)$ to be $0$ to find the maximum. \n\\begin{align*}\n0&=27\\left(3-\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right) \\\\\n&=3-\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}} \\\\\n3&=\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}} \\\\\n4a&=3\\sqrt{16-a^2} \\\\\n16a^2&=9\\left(16-a^2\\right) \\\\\n16a^2&=144-9a^2 \\\\\n25a^2&=144 \\\\\na^2&=\\dfrac{144}{25} \\\\\na&=\\dfrac{12}5 \\\\\n&=2.4. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe also find that $b=-\\sqrt{16-2.4^2}=-\\sqrt{16-5.76}=-\\sqrt{10.24}=-3.2$. \nThus, the expression we wanted to maximize becomes $81\\cdot2.4-108(-3.2)=81\\cdot2.4+108\\cdot3.2=\\boxed{540}$. \n~Technodoggo\nSame steps as solution one until we get $\\text{Re}(w)=81a-108b$. We also know $|z|=4$ or $a^2+b^2=16$. We want to find the line $81a-108b=k$ tangent to circle $a^2+b^2=16$.\nUsing $\\frac{|ax+by+c|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}=r$ we can substitute and get $\\frac{|81(0)-108(0)-k|}{\\sqrt{81^2+108^2}}=4$\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{18225}}&=4 \\\\\\frac{k}{135}&=4 \\\\k&=\\boxed{540} \\end{align*}\n~BH2019MV0\nFollow Solution 1 to get $81a-108b$. We can let $a=4\\cos\\theta$ and $b=4\\sin\\theta$ as $|z|=4$, and thus we have $324\\cos\\theta-432\\sin\\theta$. Furthermore, we can ignore the negative sign in front of the second term as we are dealing with sine and cosine, so we finally wish to maximize $324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta$ for obviously positive $\\cos\\theta$ and $\\sin\\theta$.\n\nUsing the previous fact, we can use the [Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality](https:\/\/artofproblemsolving.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Cauchy-Schwarz_Inequality) to calculate the maximum. By the inequality, we have:\n$(324^2+432^2)(\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta)\\ge(324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta)^2$\n$540^2\\cdot1\\ge(324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta)^2$\n$\\boxed{540}\\ge324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta$\n~eevee9406\nSimilar to the solutions above, we find that $Re((75+117i)z+\\frac{96+144i}{z})=81a-108b=27(3a-4b)$, where $z=a+bi$. To maximize this expression, we must maximize $3a-4b$. Let this value be $x$. Solving for $a$ yields $a=\\frac{x+4b}{3}$. From the given information we also know that $a^2+b^2=16$. Substituting $a$ in terms of $x$ and $b$ gives us $\\frac{x^2+8bx+16b^2}{9}+b^2=16$. Combining fractions, multiplying, and rearranging, gives $25b^2+8xb+(x^2-144)=0$. This is useful because we want the maximum value of $x$ such that this quadratic has real roots which is easy to find using the discriminant. For the roots to be real, $(8x)^2-4(25)(x^2-144) \\ge 0$. Now all that is left to do is to solve this inequality. Simplifying this expression, we get $-36x^2+14400 \\ge 0$ which means $x^2 \\le 400$ and $x \\le 20$. Therefore the maximum value of $x$ is $20$ and $27 \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{540}$\n~vsinghminhas\nFirst, recognize the relationship between the reciprocal of a complex number $z$ with its conjugate $\\overline{z}$, namely:\n\\[\\frac{1}{z} \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{\\overline{z}} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\]\nThen, let $z = 4(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)$ and $\\overline{z} = 4(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta)$.\n\\begin{align*} Re \\left ((75+117i)z+\\frac{96+144i}{z} \\right) &= Re\\left ( (75+117i)z + (6+9i)\\overline{z}    \\right ) \\\\                                                &= 4 \\cdot Re\\left ( (75+117i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) + (6+9i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta)    \\right ) \\\\                                                &= 4 \\cdot (75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta + 6\\cos\\theta + 9\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 4 \\cdot (81\\cos\\theta - 108\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 4\\cdot 27 \\cdot (3\\cos\\theta - 4\\sin\\theta) \\end{align*}\nNow, recognizing the 3 and 4 coefficients hinting at a 3-4-5 right triangle, we \"complete the triangle\" by rewriting our desired answer in terms of an angle of that triangle $\\phi$ where $\\cos\\phi = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $\\sin\\phi = \\frac{4}{5}$\n\\begin{align*} 4\\cdot 27 \\cdot(3\\cos\\theta - 4\\sin\\theta) &= 4\\cdot 27 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (\\frac{3}{5}\\cos\\theta - \\frac{4}{5}\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 540 \\cdot (\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 540 \\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\end{align*}\nSince the simple trig ratio is bounded above by 1, our answer is $\\boxed{540}$\n~ Cocoa @ [https:\/\/www.corgillogical.com\/](https:\/\/artofproblemsolving.comhttps:\/\/www.corgillogical.com\/)\n(yes i am a corgi that does math)\nFollow as solution 1 would to obtain $81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2}.$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have\n\\[(a^2 + (\\sqrt{16-a^2})^2)(81^2 + 108^2) \\geq (81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2})^2,\\]\nso \n\\[4^2 \\cdot 9^2 \\cdot 15^2 \\geq (81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2})^2\\]\nand we obtain that $81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2} \\leq 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 15 = \\boxed{540}.$\n\n- [spectraldragon8](https:\/\/artofproblemsolving.comhttps:\/\/artofproblemsolving.com\/wiki\/index.php\/User:Spectraldragon8)\nFollow solution 2 to get that we want to find the line $81a-108b=k$ tangent to circle $a^2+b^2=16$.
