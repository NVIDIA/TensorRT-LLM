# Contrib Examples

We create this directory to store the community contributed examples.

Contributors can add examples of customize inference time compute methods with customize Controller/Task/Worker.

We will continue to move some generic works on this directory back to the main code.

### How to create a new project

Just create a new directory and add your code there.

### How to make your code include Controller/Task/Worker can be reused by other projects

Just add your Controller/Task/Worker to the `__init__.py` file of contrib directory.
