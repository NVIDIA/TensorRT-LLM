# Recommended LLM API Configuration Settings

This directory contains recommended [LLM API](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/llm-api/) performance settings for popular models. They can be used out-of-the-box with `trtllm-serve` via the `--extra_llm_api_options` CLI flag, or you can adjust them to your specific use case.

For model-specific deployment guides, please refer to the [official documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/deployment-guide/index.html).
