["Familiar enough is the distinction between dry fruits, such as a pea pod and fleshy ones like oranges, and this quality of being fleshy or dry is practically universal. Among fleshy fruits a few well-known types may be mentioned, such as the orange, tomato, grape, gooseberry, and cranberry, all true _berries_. There are, of course, thousands of less familiar examples of berries, but, whether with a hard rind as in the orange or not, they are a direct development, or often a mere swelling of the ovary, with sometimes the adhering calyx, and contain the seed. In apples and pears, known as _pomes_, the fleshy part is a development of part calyx and part the receptacle upon which the ovary is supported while still in the flower. The ovary in these fruits is the parchmentlike interior which contains the seed. Plums and cherries, which have a single stone, instead of numerous seeds buried in the flesh, are known as drupes. These familiar examples are matched by thousands of others of which we hear nothing, all _drupes_ and all formed directly from the ripened ovary and without much change, except the increase of size, juiciness and large development of the tiny immature seed, now transformed into a stone. In the watermelon, pumpkin, and related plants, is still another kind of fleshy fruit, called a _pepo_. All of this, including the hard rind, is transformed ovary and calyx completely incorporated, and forming in the pumpkin perhaps the largest fleshy fruit known. In a considerable number of plants there is not a single ovary, but several, or in some cases many. These occasionally all develop into what is called an aggregate fruit, of which examples are the blackberry, mulberry, magnolia, and many others. While it would be logical to think that these fleshy fruits were designed to make delicious food for man, that, in the light of what we have seen to be the real function of the flower, is an assumption which, while flattering, is far from the truth. It is much more certain that fleshy fruits help plants in the dispersal of their seeds and that this fleshy, juicy character is just one more device of nature to see to it that not only do plants produce seeds, but that the seeds are carried and so spread the plant over considerable areas. Birds and animals eat such fruits in enormous quantities and, in fact, bird migrations are thought to be not so much response to winter cold as to the fact that fruits are scarce then. When it is remembered that some birds make tremendous flights, often over 10,000 miles in a few days, their capacity to spread seeds through their droppings may be imagined. In the chapter on plant distribution some truly remarkable cases of such seed dispersal will be given. The chance of having seed carried great distances, because it is embedded in a fleshy, often brightly colored fruit, would seem to put plants having dry fruits at a disadvantage. Birds and animals cannot be expected to look after the dispersal of those fruits that are neither tempting to the sight nor to the taste. And it must be confessed that quite other qualities in dry fruits insure their dispersal. Some are so nutritious, like the _acorn_, that thrifty squirrels store them over the winter, as they do many other seeds which are harvested from dry fruits. Various grains are often so stored by man, and rice, wheat, buckwheat, and other cereals are common cases. In nearly all grains the seed fills so completely the fruit that cereals are very generally, but mistakenly, called seeds. A grain of wheat or corn is just as complete a fruit as a watermelon. Only its outer coat and inner seed are so closely welded together as not to be usually recognized as a fruit, with the seed inside. One of the commonest types of dry fruit is the _capsule_ (Figure 53), well named, as it is almost an exact counterpart of the capsule of the druggist, in that it is in many cases composed of a lower part and an upper, usually merely a domed lid. Others again, instead of splitting around the sides, split from top to bottom. Still others, as peas and beans, known as _legumes_ (Figure 57), are pods that not only split lengthwise, but have no central partition, as do many other fruits of the same general type. When the seed is ripe nearly all pods and _legumes_ finally split open, and the seed or seeds tumble out. A few, as in the violet and touch-me-not or jewelweed, apparently realizing that merely to spill out ripe seeds at the proper time will not spread the species very far, open their fruits with a sudden explosion and literally shoot their seeds considerable distances. The artillery plant, commonly grown in greenhouses, a delicate feathery herb from tropical America, opens its flowers with a report like a toy popgun and shoots its small pollen grains for several feet, but not its seeds as stated by some. But many fruits do not open at all and seem to be at the greatest disadvantage in the effort to insure [Illustration: FIGS. 52-60.--TYPES OF DRY FRUITS Fig. 52. The strawberry.

Greater food value to birds and animals overcomes this in some kinds, and another help is that some fruits of this sort are covered with hooked prickles or barbs (Figures 54 and 60). The common weedy burdock, the barbed fruits of which may often be found sticking to the fur of animals in great quantities, is a case in point. There are whole groups of plants that rely on this method for seed dispersal, notably the avens, tick-seed, tick trefoil, and many shrubs in the tropical regions. Where the fruits are neither barbed nor very good to eat, and so apparently doomed to be more or less permanent stay-at-homes, nature has provided some of them with the proper equipment for flight through the air. Winged fruits like the maple are to be seen on any windy day during their season scurrying before the breeze, and consequently spreading their kind over considerable distances. In the maple there are two wings, joined at the base where the seeds are embedded in the wings, and the fruit is known as a _samara_ (Figure 58), or key fruit, from a slight resemblance to an old-fashioned key. Ash trees bear fruits that are a slight modification of this type and may be carried considerable distances by the wind (Figure 59). In the dandelion, daisy, and nearly all its thousands of relatives, this faculty of setting sail in the air has been carried to the greatest perfection, just as we saw its flowers were. In this family of plants, the largest in the world, the fruit is mostly tipped or surrounded by a small collection of very fine bristles. The fruit, known as an _achene_ (Figure 56), is so light that with the added buoyancy of this tiny collection of down it can be transported great distances. Some have been known to fly hundreds of miles in severe storms, and, as we shall see in the chapter on plant distribution, these tiny plant balloons have played a conspicuous part in spreading their kind over the face of the earth. Cat-tails also, together with many other plants, have this faculty and make up by its possession for the lack of fleshy or otherwise desirable fruits that might be carried. All _achenes_ are not winged, those which dot the surface of the strawberry being imbedded in the luscious flesh, which is not really fruit at all. Only the achenes on the strawberry are true fruits, the fleshy part being merely a development of the upper part of the flower stalk and not of the ovary (Figure 52). Fruits, then, cannot be restricted to the common understanding of them. They are transformations of the ovary, in which or upon which seeds are nursed, and upon which most plants depend for the dispersal of their seeds. We shall see later on how fruits have fulfilled their destiny, how some are fit for their true function only when they have been eaten by birds, and when some digestive juice has released them from the impotence they would suffer without being eaten, how a whole forest has been changed in the West by the busy activity of squirrels upon the fruits and seeds of a single kind of fir tree; how the fruit of the coconut palm has been spread throughout the tropical world because it can float in the sea securely protected from injury from salt by the impervious coverings of its fruits. THE SEED As the final stage in the development of all plants is their seed, with the dropping of which they bid good-by to their fellows, it is not perhaps remarkable that in the seed of all flowering plants is the germ for the new generation. To seeds which may be as small as the mustard, so often mentioned in the Bible, or as large as the coco de mer, or double coconut, from the Seychelles Islands, often fifty pounds or over, is intrusted by cunning nature the one final and most important act in the whole kingdom of the plant world. Nearly all plants would die off forever if seeds did not have in them the germ of life, apparently quite dead, but actually only dormant. This living germ may persist for years, sometimes even a hundred years, and yet with the proper conditions it never fails to sprout. Seeds have inside them a tiny plantlet folded and ready to grow when the seed splits to release it. Also, in the seed is stored up food to sustain the new plant until such time as its own roots begin to act. This young plantlet is known as the _embryo_, and to this all actions of the seed are subservient. As the seed splits, and the young plant develops its first leaves and rootlets, there is shown one of the most remarkably uniform tendencies in plant life. In all plants with net-veined leaves the young plantlet starts life with two leaves, or _cotyledons_, as these first leaves are called, and this whole group of plants are thus known as _dicotyledons_. In plants with parallel-veined leaves the young plantlets start out with a single cotyledon and are therefore called _monocotyledons_. In only the pines, spruce, and a few other evergreen trees the seedling plants have several cotyledons and are known as _polycotyledons_. All the flowering plants in the world belong to one of these groups, so that merely to see the germinating seed tells the story at once. The linking of parallel-veined leaves and a single seed leaf, and net-veined leaves with two seed leaves, is also associated with very definite arrangement of their flower parts, their method of growth and other characters. Something has already been said of this in the discussion of stems and leaves, and more will be found in the chapter on plant families. No more beautiful example of the plan or scheme of nature is to be found than these characteristics of all plants, and in seeds we find the first hint as to which army the plant will join, under which banner it will fight, and under what generalship it will develop. Nothing tells us so much as these first seed leaves, pushing their way up through the soil and revealing, as they burst above ground, to what place in nature their destiny will consign them. Flowering plants, which make up the bulk of the vegetation of the earth, have been discussed in some detail, not only because they furnish us with all the things that make life possible, but also because they show perhaps better than anything else the division of labor, all striving for one end. Roots, the food gatherers. Stems, the framework for the foliage and its means of reaching the light, or as a storage house for reserve food. Leaves of many kinds, all factories working night and day to make the necessary food. Flowers of every hue and shape to lure insects, or by other means secure union of male and female. Fruits to ripen the result of this mating of the sexes. And, finally, the seed carrying with it the yet unborn life. Each part occasionally losing itself in order that the end may be accomplished, many of them changing their form or even their function where that is of advantage, all in their separate ways doing their task, the end of which they cannot see, and the fruits of which they will never enjoy. Nowhere is it so true as in plants that to save oneself there must be the capacity to give oneself. Untold millions of leaves fall, or trees crash down, or seeds are developed, each fulfilling their destiny which is to insure the perpetuation of their kind. As we shall see later on, there are many mistakes, many apparently futile attempts, thousands are wiped out that one may be saved, and in the past multitudes have gone out forever. Yet the result of it all is the plant world as we know it to-day, each kind struggling to increase its sphere of influence, or to cover more of the earth’s area. The combat between different kinds is inexorable, yet the capacity for sacrifice on the part of different organs, in order that a certain individual kind may win, is literally beyond belief. 2. FLOWERLESS PLANTS In the light of what has been said about flowers it may well be questioned how anything can be a plant and still have no flower. The fact is that flowers as we commonly understand them are unknown in the plants about to be discussed, but that what _corresponds_ to a flower, and performs the _function_ of a flower all plants must and do have. In the case of most flowering plants the possession of flowers is one of the beauties of nature in its most resplendent mood, while in the so-called flowerless plants the functions of flowers are performed by tiny microscopic organs, even the existence of which has been only recently discovered. Because flowering plants produce their sexual organs in such a gorgeous setting, for all the world to see their matings they have been called _phanerogams_, which means literally visible marriage, while the flowerless plants which perform similar functions in more secret ways are called _cryptogams_, meaning hidden marriage. These _cryptogams_ or flowerless plants occur in far greater numbers in the world than flowering plants, but their size in most cases is very much less. Many individuals are so small, as in the case of bacteria, that a single one can only be seen after it has been magnified many hundreds of times by the microscope. Of the cryptogams some of the largest, certainly the most beautiful, and probably the best known are THE FERNS In nearly all woods one may find delicate feathery plants with graceful, usually much divided leaves that nearly always start up from the ground like a slowly opening, but somewhat fuzzy coil. (Figure 62.) Ferns, at least most of those that grow in America, uncoil their leaves in this way, almost without exception. The accompanying figure shows the procedure, and in addition to this character one may hunt in vain for flowers. While they bear no flowers we already know that nature could not leave them with no means of reproduction without abandoning them to a childless old age and the consequent extinction of the race of ferns. So far from the truth is this that ferns make up a goodly proportion of the world’s vegetation, and there are many hundreds of different kinds known. The lack of flowers, of course, explains why ferns do not bear seeds which are matured in a fruit or ripened ovary. On the back of the leaves of most ferns, along or near the edges of the finer subdivisions, one may [Illustration: FIGS. 61-63.--COMMON WOODLAND FERN Fig. 61. A general view. Fig. 62. Its uncoiling spring condition. Fig. 63. The back of one of the smaller divisions of the leaf showing the collection of spore cases (sori). These are sometimes borne on special leaves, but in most of our American kinds on the backs of ordinary foliage leaves.] find, at the proper season, collections or rows of tiny, usually brownish dots. These contain often thousands of microscopic objects known generally as _spores_, and from this fact the dots are called spore-cases, or more technically _sori_. (Figure 63.) The process by which new plants are formed is a [Illustration: AERIAL ROOTS OF FIG TREES HANGING OVER THE EDGE OF A CAVE IN THE RAIN FOREST, SAN LORENZO, SANTO DOMINGO. (_Photo by the author. Courtesy of Brooklyn Botanic Garden._)] [Illustration: VENUS’S FLYTRAP, AN INSECTIVOROUS PLANT OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. The fringed valves of its leaves close together when an insect alights between them. (_Courtesy of Brooklyn Botanic Garden._)] somewhat complicated one, but the spores in these brown dots are the agency which makes reproduction possible, and the actual mechanism of it, one of the most interesting achievements in plant life, will be described in the chapter on “How Plants Produce Their Young.” Sometimes the spores are not borne on the backs of ordinary foliage leaves but on special leaves that bear, very often, nothing else. Ferns are much like ordinary flowering plants; except for their lack of flowers, they have all the root, stem, and leaf characters of their more showy neighbors. While most of them have compound leaves, even sometimes twice or thrice compounded, a few have simple, narrow leaves without teeth, and one kind in tropical America has threadlike leaves. In many tropical rain forests, so called from their dripping wet condition, ferns form large trees, and these tree ferns are among the most graceful and feathery of all plants."]
