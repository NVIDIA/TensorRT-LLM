### :title Run trtllm-serve with pytorch backend on Slurm
### :order 2
### :section Slurm

# NOTE, this feature is experimental and may not work on all systems.
# The trtllm-llmapi-launch is a script that launches the LLM-API code on
# Slurm-like systems, and can support multi-node and multi-GPU setups.

# Note that, the number of MPI processes should be the same as the model world
# size. e.g. For tensor_parallel_size=16, you may use 2 nodes with 8 gpus for
# each, or 4 nodes with 4 gpus for each or other combinations.

# This docker image should have tensorrt_llm installed, or you need to install
# it in the task.

# The following variables are expected to be set in the environment:
# You can set them via --export in the srun/sbatch command.
#   CONTAINER_IMAGE: the docker image to use, you'd better install tensorrt_llm in it, or install it in the task.
#   MOUNT_DIR: the directory to mount in the container
#   MOUNT_DEST: the destination directory in the container
#   WORKDIR: the working directory in the container
#   SOURCE_ROOT: the path to the TensorRT LLM source
#   PROLOGUE: the prologue to run before the script
#   LOCAL_MODEL: the local model directory to use, NOTE: downloading from HF is
#      not supported in Slurm mode, you need to download the model and put it in
#      the LOCAL_MODEL directory.

echo "Starting trtllm-serve..."
# Just launch trtllm-serve job with trtllm-llmapi-launch command.
