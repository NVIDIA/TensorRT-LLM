# Multimodal Support in TensorRT LLM

TensorRT LLM supports a variety of multimodal models, enabling efficient inference with inputs beyond just text.

---

## Background

Multimodal LLMs typically handle non-text inputs by combining a multimodal encoder with an LLM decoder. The encoder first transforms non-text modality input into embeddings, which are then fused with text embeddings and fed into the LLM decoder for downstream inference. Compared to standard LLM inference, multimodal LLM inference involves three additional stages to support non-text modalities.

* **Multimodal Input Processor**: Preprocess raw multimodal input into a format suitable for the multimodal encoder, such as pixel values for vision models.
* **Multimodal Encoder**: Encodes the processed input into embeddings that are aligned with the LLM’s embedding space.
* **Integration with LLM Decoder**: Fuses multimodal embeddings with text embeddings as the input to the LLM decoder.

## Optimizations

TensorRT LLM incorporates some key optimizations to enhance the performance of multimodal inference:

* **In-Flight Batching**: Batches multimodal requests within the GPU executor to improve GPU utilization and throughput.
* **CPU/GPU Concurrency**: Asynchronously overlaps data preprocessing on the CPU with image encoding on the GPU.
* **Raw data hashing**: Leverages image hashes and token chunk information to improve KV cache reuse and minimize collisions.

Further optimizations are under development and will be updated as they become available.

## Model Support Matrix

Please refer to the latest multimodal [support matrix](../models/supported-models.md#multimodal-feature-support-matrix-pytorch-backend).

## Optional dependencies

Video input decoding uses OpenCV (`cv2`) and is not installed by default. Install it only for models with video inputs:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless
```

Image-only and text-only workflows do not require this package.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use TensorRT LLM's multimodal support in various scenarios, including quick run examples, serving endpoints, and performance benchmarking.

### Quick start

Quickly try out TensorRT LLM's multimodal support using our `LLM-API` and a ready-to-run [example](source:examples/llm-api/quickstart_multimodal.py). The script imports helpers from its sibling file [`quickstart_advanced.py`](source:examples/llm-api/quickstart_advanced.py), so run it from a checkout of the `examples/llm-api/` directory rather than as a single downloaded file:

```bash
# Get the examples directory first; quickstart_multimodal.py imports from
# quickstart_advanced.py next to it.
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM.git
cd TensorRT-LLM/examples/llm-api
python3 quickstart_multimodal.py --model_dir Efficient-Large-Model/NVILA-8B --modality image --disable_kv_cache_reuse
```

### OpenAI-Compatible Server via [`trtllm-serve`](../../source/commands/trtllm-serve/trtllm-serve.rst)

Launch an OpenAI-compatible server with multimodal support using the `trtllm-serve` command, for example:

```bash
trtllm-serve Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct  --backend pytorch
```

You can then send OpenAI-compatible requests, such as via curl or API clients, to the server endpoint. See [curl chat client for multimodal script](source:examples/serve/curl_chat_client_for_multimodal.sh) as an example.

`trtllm-serve` renders the chat template itself and marks the resulting `TextPrompt` with `chat_template_applied`, as do the multimodal prompt builders in `tensorrt_llm.inputs.utils`. An input processor that would otherwise apply the chat template to a raw `prompt` should use such a prompt verbatim; see `TextPrompt` in `tensorrt_llm/inputs/data.py`.

### Run with [`trtllm-bench`](../../source/commands/trtllm-bench.rst)

Evaluate offline inference performance with multimodal inputs using the `trtllm-bench` tool. For detailed instructions, see the [benchmarking guide](../developer-guide/perf-benchmarking.md).

## Tensor-parallel tensor transport

Multimodal tensor storage is shared automatically from rank 0 to its local tensor-parallel peers.
No environment variable or model-specific flag is required.
This applies to models using `py_multimodal_data` with a single-host MPI tensor-parallel group.
Pipeline parallelism, context parallelism, non-MPI distribution, and groups spanning multiple hosts keep the existing transport.

The transport reuses `SharedTensorContainer` for CPU shared memory and CUDA IPC, with one reduction reference per receiving rank.
CPU tensors reuse shared storage or move to shared storage once.
CUDA tensors use one locally owned copy because imported CUDA allocations cannot be exported again.
Only multimodal data is transformed; nested metadata types and unrelated request attributes are preserved.
Empty tensors, negative views, unsupported dtypes or layouts, tensors requiring gradients, and overlapping CUDA views keep byte transport.

A collective acknowledgement retires handles that peers could not map.
Mapped storage stays alive through the final consumer and is released by the existing completion, cancellation, and error cleanup.
Graceful export, mapping, and serialization failures propagate to all ranks.
Abrupt MPI rank loss is not qualified.
