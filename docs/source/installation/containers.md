# Pre-built release container images on NGC

Pre-built TensorRT-LLM releases are made available as container images
on NGC. This is likely the simplest way to obtain TensorRT-LLM. Please refer to the [documentation in NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/tensorrt-llm/containers/release) for usage instructions.

Containers can also be built locally, see
