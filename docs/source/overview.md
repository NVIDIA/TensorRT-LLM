# Overview

## About TensorRT LLM

[TensorRT LLM](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) is NVIDIA's comprehensive open-source library for accelerating and optimizing inference performance of the latest large language models (LLMs) on NVIDIA GPUs. 

## Key Capabilities

### ðŸ”¥ **Architected on Pytorch**

TensorRT LLM provides a high-level Python [LLM API](./quick-start-guide.md#run-offline-inference-with-llm-api) that supports a wide range of inference setups - from single-GPU to multi-GPU or multi-node deployments. It includes built-in support for various parallelism strategies and advanced features. The LLM API integrates seamlessly with the broader inference ecosystem, including NVIDIA [Dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo) and the [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server).

TensorRT LLM is designed to be modular and easy to modify. Its PyTorch-native architecture allows developers to experiment with the runtime or extend functionality. Several popular models are also pre-defined and can be customized using [native PyTorch code](source:tensorrt_llm/_torch/models/modeling_deepseekv3.py), making it easy to adapt the system to specific needs.

### âš¡ **State-of-the-Art Performance**

TensorRT LLM delivers breakthrough performance on the latest NVIDIA GPUs:
