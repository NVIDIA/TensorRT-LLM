# LLM API with TensorRT Engine
A simple inference example with TinyLlama using the LLM API:

```{literalinclude} ../../../examples/llm-api/_tensorrt_engine/quickstart_example.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
```

For more advanced usage including distributed inference, multimodal, and speculative decoding, please refer to this [README](../../../examples/llm-api/README.md).
