"""Attention Interface to handle various attention operators and cache operations.

This module provides an interface between the high-level runtime and cache management system and
the low-level functional attention operators. The interface is designed to provide a homogeneous
object-oriented interface to the high-level runtime via the SequenceInfo dataclass. The SequenceInfo
is also responsible for functionalizing information about the sequence and pass it on the the
various attention interface. The AttentionDescriptor is the main interface to the attention operator
and operates on a purely functional paradigm that is compatible with the torch custom op system.

class SequenceInfo:
    """An interface to hold information about how the sequence is laid out and stored in cache.

    We assume the sequence + cache is laid out in the following way. Also note that we differentiate
    between arguments that are originally part of the model/graph and arguments that are needed for
    the attention operator when we switch to cached+flattened attention.

    ### ORIGINAL MODEL ARGUMENTS ###################################################################
    - input_ids: [id_0, ..., id_{s_total-1}]
      flattened sequence of [b, 1] or [1, s_total]. We use [b, 1] to denote generate-only batches.
    - position_ids: [pos_0, ..., pos_{s_total-1}]
      flattened sequence of [b, 1] or [1, s_total] indicating absolute position ids for every token
      in the input_ids sequence. We use [b, 1] to denote generate-only batches.

    NOTE: ``input_ids`` and ``position_ids`` are initially expected to be of shape [b, seq_len]
    before we switch to cached+flattened attention.

    ### EXTRA ARGUMENTS PROVIDED TO THE INTERFACE ##################################################
    Those are extra arguments that can be provided to the interface and they are stored as follows:
    - _extra_args: dictionary of extra arguments with currently active values.

    ### CACHE ARGUMENTS NEEDED FOR ATTENTION OPERATORS FOR FLATTENED SEQUENCES + CACHES ############
    - seq_len: [s_0, s_1, ..., s_{b-1}] such that s_total = sum(s_i)
      Describes how long each sequence is. For example,
      input_ids[:s_0] will correspond to sequence 0 in the batch and input_ids[s_0:s_1] will
      correspond to sequence 1 in the batch.
    - input_pos: [pos_0, ..., pos_{b-1}]
      Corresponds to the total number of tokens that has been already been cached for each sequence
      in the batch.
    - cache_loc: [c0, ...., c_{np-1}] where np is total number of pages allocated to describe all
      sequences in the batch.
    - pages_per_seq: [ps_0, ps_1, ..., ps_{b-1}] where ps_i is the number of pages allocated for
      sequence i. Note that, for example, cache_loc[p_0:p_1] will correspond to the pages associated
      with sequence 1 in the batch.
    - slot_idx: [s_0, s_1, ..., s_{b-1}]
      Corresponds to the slot index of each sequence in the batch.

    ################################################################################################

    Here are a couple of notes to emphasize this notation:

    - The total number of allocated token space for sequence i is given by ps_i * page_size. This is
      the total number of tokens that can be cached for each sequence.

    - NOTE: It must hold that pos_i + s_i <= ps_i * page_size for all i in [0, b-1]. Moreover, it is
      the responsibility of the cache manager and/or runtime to ensure sufficient page allocation
      for each sequence.
