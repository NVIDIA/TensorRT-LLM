"""BF16 ``y = x @ weight.T`` for at most 32 rows on the built-in low-M split-K kernel, at a fixed tactic.

The built-in low-M dispatcher (``_torch/modules/low_m_gemm.py``) races the
flashinfer CuTe-DSL split-K and direct kernels against cuBLAS per shape on
each rank and caches the winner per rank; ranks can and do settle on
different kernels for one shape, and plain ``nn.Linear`` / ``F.linear`` call
sites never reach it. This entry is the split-K kernel the dispatcher would
launch, with the tactic chosen by the caller: one tactic per shape, the same
on every rank, measured once on the target GPU (``SPLITK_TACTICS``).

The kernel accumulates in fp32 and rounds once; its K-split differs from
cuBLAS's, so results differ from ``F.linear`` in the last bf16 place on a few
elements -- the same distance from the fp64 product as cuBLAS.
