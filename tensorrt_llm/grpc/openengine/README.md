# TensorRT-LLM OpenEngine server

`trtllm-serve` can expose an experimental OpenEngine gRPC server instead of its normal OpenAI HTTP server. SMG remains the default gRPC protocol.

Install the optional Python bindings from the Buf Schema Registry:

```bash
python -m pip install \
  --extra-index-url https://buf.build/gen/python \
  "tensorrt_llm[openengine]"
```

Then select OpenEngine when starting the gRPC server:

```bash
trtllm-serve <model> \
  --grpc \
  --grpc-protocol openengine \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 50051
```

Existing `--grpc` invocations continue to select SMG. OpenEngine and VisualGen cannot be enabled together.

The `Inference.Generate` RPC loads the selected model through TensorRT-LLM's PyTorch `LLM` API and streams incremental token and text events. It supports text and token-ID inputs, native sampling and stopping options, top-N prompt and output log probabilities, TensorRT-LLM guided-decoding modes, cache salt, trace-context propagation, multiple output sequences, finish reasons, and final usage.

Clients must continuously consume the response stream. If response delivery remains stalled for 30 seconds, the server aborts the engine request and terminates the stream with a retryable overload error.

Features without a faithful TensorRT-LLM mapping return `UNIMPLEMENTED`: OpenEngine KV sessions and prefix-cache bypass, LoRA lifecycle selection, multimodal media, explicit-token or all-vocabulary log-probability selection, nonzero prompt-logprob offsets, per-request grammar-backend selection, and priority or data-parallel-rank metadata. The AutoDeploy backend is rejected at startup until it supports request cancellation. Other `Control` RPCs remain unimplemented.

OpenEngine and SMG are independent protocol integrations. This integration does not make a replacement or convergence decision between them.

## Dependency provenance

The schema source is the Apache-2.0-licensed [`ai-dynamo/openengine`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/openengine) repository at signed Git tag [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/openengine/releases/tag/v0.1.0). That release maps to the public [`buf.build/openengine/openengine`](https://buf.build/openengine/openengine) module at immutable BSR commit `768a93c7b44e40f28c692ad0b471a8f2`.

The BSR generated the pinned wheels from that module commit:

Buf documents the package naming and version format in its [Python-generated SDK guide](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/python/). The final version segment is the BSR commit prefix. The exact requirements are pinned in `requirements-openengine.txt`.

## Maintenance boundary

The OpenEngine contributor community owns this adapter, its tests, protocol version updates, and integration bugs. TensorRT-LLM internal APIs do not provide compatibility guarantees to protocol adapters. Adapter updates must follow core runtime changes and must not block normal TensorRT-LLM development or releases.
